    "task": "Sophia is swimming at a speed of 3 miles per hour and rowing at a speed of 4 miles per hour. She spends $ w $ hours swimming and $ r $ hours rowing for a combined total of 25 miles. Which equation represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The total distance covered consists of two parts:\nThe distance covered while swimming: $ 3 \times w $.\nThe distance covered while rowing: $ 4 \times r $.\nSince the total distance covered is 25 miles, the equation becomes:\n$ 3w + 4r = 25 $.",
