    "task": "Daniel bought party hats and cupcakes for 125 Dollars. Each party hat costs 4 Dollars, and each cupcake costs 1 Dollar. If Daniel bought 10 party hats, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\\n4 Dollars times 10 = 40 Dollars.\\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 125 Dollars - 40 Dollars = 85 Dollars.\\nSince each cupcake costs 1 Dollar, we divide: 85 Dollars รท 1 Dollar = 85.\\nThus, Daniel bought 85 cupcakes.",
