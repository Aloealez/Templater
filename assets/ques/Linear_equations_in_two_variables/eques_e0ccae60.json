  "task": "Daniel bought party hats and cupcakes for $125. Each party hats cost $4, and each cupcakes cost $1. If Daniel bought 10 party hats, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n$4 \times 10 = $40.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $125 - $40 = $85.\nSince each cupcakes costs $1, we divide: $85 รท $1 = 85.\nThus, Daniel bought 85 cupcakes.",
