    "task": "Daniel bought party hats and cupcakes for 125{dollars}. Each party hats cost 4{dollars}, and each cupcakes cost 1{dollars}. If Daniel bought 10 party hats, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n{dollars}4 times 10 = {dollars}40.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: {dollars}125 - {dollars}40 = {dollars}85.\nSince each cupcakes costs {dollars}1, we divide: {dollars}85 \u00f7 {dollars}1 = {dollars}\nThus, Daniel bought 85 cupcakes.",
