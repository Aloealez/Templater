    "task": "Line p is defined by the equation $ 10y + -1x = 190 $. Line r is perpendicular to line p in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line r?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$\\frac{-1}{10}$",
        "B": "$\\frac{1}{10}$",
        "C": "$\\frac{10}{1}$",
        "D": "$\\frac{-10}{1}$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "The given equation of line p is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = \\frac{1}{10}x + b $. This means the slope of line p is \\frac{1}{10}. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of \\frac{1}{10} is \\frac{-10}{1}. Thus, the slope of line r is \\frac{-10}{1}.",
