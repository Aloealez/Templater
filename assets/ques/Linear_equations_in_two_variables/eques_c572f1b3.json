    "task": "Line $k$ is defined by $ y = x - 4 $. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $ j $?",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Since line $j$ is perpendicular to line $ k $, its slope is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of line $ k $. \nThe equation for line $k$ is given as $ y = x - 4 $, meaning its slope is $ 1 $. \nThe opposite reciprocal of $ 1 $ is $ -\\frac{1}{1} $. \nThus, the slope of line $j$ is $ -\\frac{1}{1} $.",
