    "task": "Line q is defined by the equation $ 3y + -9x = 6 $. Line w is perpendicular to line q in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line w?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "\\frac{1}{3}",
        "B": "\\frac{-1}{3}",
        "C": "\\frac{-3}{1}",
        "D": "\\frac{3}{1}"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The given equation of line q is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = \\frac{3}{1}x + b $. This means the slope of line q is \\frac{3}{1}. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of \\frac{3}{1} is \\frac{-1}{3}. Thus, the slope of line w is \\frac{-1}{3}.",
