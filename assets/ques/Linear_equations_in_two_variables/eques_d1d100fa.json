  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = \\frac{15}{17}x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\(\\frac{-15}{17}\\)",
    "B": "\\(\\frac{15}{17}\\)",
    "C": "\\(\\frac{5}{6}\\)",
    "D": "\\(\\frac{-17}{15}\\)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = \\frac{15}{17}x + b$, so its slope is $ \\frac{15}{17} $. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of $ \\frac{15}{17} $, which is \\(\\frac{-17}{15}\\). Thus, the correct answer is \\(\\frac{-17}{15}\\).",
