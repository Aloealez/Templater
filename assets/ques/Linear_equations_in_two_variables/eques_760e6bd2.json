  "task": "A line passes through the points $(-16, 20)$ and $(12, 18)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{-3}{14}",
    "B": "\\frac{-1}{14}",
    "C": "\\frac{0}{1}",
    "D": "\\frac{-1}{15}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $\\frac{-1}{14}$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \\frac{18 - 20}{12 - -16} = \\frac{-1}{14}$. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{-1}{14}, or approximately -0.071 in decimal form.",
