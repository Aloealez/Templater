    "task": "Sophia bought party hats and stickers for 139{dollars}. Each party hats cost 2{dollars}, and each stickers cost 1{dollars}. If Sophia bought 10 party hats, how many stickers did Sophia buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many stickers Sophia bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n2{dollars} times 10 = 20{dollars}.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 139{dollars} - 20{dollars} = 119{dollars}.\nSince each stickers costs 1{dollars}, we divide: 119{dollars} \u00f7 1{dollars} = 119.\nThus, Sophia bought 119 stickers.",
