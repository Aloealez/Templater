    "task": "Sophia bought party hats and stickers for 139Dollars. Each party hats cost 2Dollars, and each stickers cost 1Dollars. If Sophia bought 10 party hats, how many stickers did Sophia buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many stickers Sophia bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n2Dollars times 10 = 20Dollars.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 139Dollars - 20Dollars = 119Dollars.\nSince each stickers costs 1Dollars, we divide: 119Dollars \u00f7 1Dollars = 119.\nThus, Sophia bought 119 stickers.",
