  "task": "A line passes through the points $(0, 1)$ and $(-11, 16)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-5/4",
    "B": "-15/11",
    "C": "-13/11",
    "D": "-14/11"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $-15/11$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \frac{16 - 1}{-11 - 0} = -15/11$. Thus, the correct answer is -15/11, or approximately -1.364 in decimal form.",
