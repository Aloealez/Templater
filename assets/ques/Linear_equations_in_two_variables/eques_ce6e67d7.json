  "task": "Line p is defined by the equation $ 6y + -6x = 78 $. Line r is perpendicular to line p in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line r?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1",
    "B": "-1",
    "C": "1",
    "D": "-1"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line p is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 1x + b $. This means the slope of line p is 1. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 1 is -1. Thus, the slope of line r is -1.",
