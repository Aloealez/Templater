  "task": "A line passes through the points $(19, 18)$ and $(-11, -12)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{2}{1}",
    "B": "\\frac{3}{1}",
    "C": "\\frac{1}{2}",
    "D": "\\frac{1}{1}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $\\frac{1}{1}$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \\frac{-12 - 18}{-11 - 19} = \\frac{1}{1}$. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{1}{1}, or approximately 1.0 in decimal form.",
