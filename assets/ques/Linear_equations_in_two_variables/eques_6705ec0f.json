  "task": "Line m is defined by the equation $ 3y + -7x = 3 $. Line l is perpendicular to line m in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line l?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "3/7",
    "B": "-7/3",
    "C": "-3/7",
    "D": "7/3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line m is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 7/3x + b $. This means the slope of line m is 7/3. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 7/3 is -3/7. Thus, the slope of line l is -3/7.",
