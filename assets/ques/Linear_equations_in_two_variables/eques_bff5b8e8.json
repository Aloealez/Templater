  "task": "Line s is defined by the equation $ 7y + -12x = 7 $. Line w is perpendicular to line s in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line w?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-7/12",
    "B": "-12/7",
    "C": "12/7",
    "D": "7/12"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line s is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 12/7x + b $. This means the slope of line s is 12/7. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 12/7 is -7/12. Thus, the slope of line w is -7/12.",
