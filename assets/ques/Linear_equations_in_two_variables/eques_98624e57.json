  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = -5/2x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "2/5",
    "B": "-5/2",
    "C": "5/2",
    "D": "-5/3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = -5/2x + b$, so its slope is -5/2. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of -5/2, which is 2/5. Thus, the correct answer is 2/5.",
