  "task": "Line p is defined by the equation $ 4y + -20x = 48 $. Line r is perpendicular to line p in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line r?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{-1}{5}",
    "B": "\\frac{-5}{1}",
    "C": "\\frac{1}{5}",
    "D": "\\frac{5}{1}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line p is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = \\frac{5}{1}x + b $. This means the slope of line p is \\frac{5}{1}. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of \\frac{5}{1} is \\frac{-1}{5}. Thus, the slope of line r is \\frac{-1}{5}.",
