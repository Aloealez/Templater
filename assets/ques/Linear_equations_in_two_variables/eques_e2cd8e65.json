    "task": "Line q is defined by the equation $ 1y + -8x = 6 $. Line l is perpendicular to line q in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line l?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$\\frac{1}{8}$",
        "B": "$\\frac{-8}{1}$",
        "C": "$\\frac{-1}{8}$",
        "D": "$\\frac{8}{1}$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The given equation of line q is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = \\frac{8}{1}x + b $. This means the slope of line q is \\frac{8}{1}. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of \\frac{8}{1} is \\frac{-1}{8}. Thus, the slope of line l is \\frac{-1}{8}.",
