    "task": "Line $k$ is defined by $ y = 10x - 7 $. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Since line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$, its slope is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of line $k$. \\nThe equation for line $k$ is given as $ y = 10x - 7 $, meaning its slope is $ 10 $. \\nThe opposite reciprocal of $ 10 $ is $ -\\frac{1}{10} $. \\nThus, the slope of line $j$ is $ -\\frac{1}{10} $.",
