    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. The total budget is represented by $x$, and $y$ represents the allocated portion. The remaining amount is 307 euros. \\nSince the total budget is $x$, subtracting the allocated budget $y$ gives us: \\n$ x - y = 307 $, which correctly represents the relationship.",
