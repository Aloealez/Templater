  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = 7/9x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "7/9",
    "B": "7/10",
    "C": "-9/7",
    "D": "-7/9"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = 7/9x + b$, so its slope is 7/9. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of 7/9, which is -9/7. Thus, the correct answer is -9/7.",
