  "task": "A line passes through the points $(9, 4)$ and $(7, 14)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-6/1",
    "B": "-3/1",
    "C": "-5/2",
    "D": "-5/1"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $-5/1$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \frac{14 - 4}{7 - 9} = -5$. Thus, the correct answer is -5/1, or approximately -5.0 in decimal form.",
