  "task": "A line passes through the points $(5, 19)$ and $(-20, 3)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{17}{25}",
    "B": "\\frac{8}{13}",
    "C": "\\frac{14}{25}",
    "D": "\\frac{16}{25}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $\\frac{16}{25}$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \\frac{3 - 19}{-20 - 5} = \\frac{16}{25}$. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{16}{25}, or approximately 0.64 in decimal form.",
