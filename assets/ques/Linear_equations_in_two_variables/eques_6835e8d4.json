  "task": "Line k is defined by the equation $ 8y + -4x = 72 $. Line j is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line j?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1/2",
    "B": "-2",
    "C": "2",
    "D": "-1/2"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line k is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 1/2x + b $. This means the slope of line k is 1/2. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 1/2 is -2. Thus, the slope of line j is -2.",
