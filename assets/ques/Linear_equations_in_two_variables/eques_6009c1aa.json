  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = -10/19x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "10/19",
    "B": "19/10",
    "C": "-1/2",
    "D": "-10/19"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = -10/19x + b$, so its slope is -10/19. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of -10/19, which is 19/10. Thus, the correct answer is 19/10.",
