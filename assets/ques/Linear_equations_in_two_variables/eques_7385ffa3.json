    "task": "What is the equation of the line that passes through the point $ (0, -8) $ and is parallel to the graph of $ y = 9x + 5 $ in the xy-plane?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The equation of a line in the xy-plane is written as $ y = mx + b $, where $ m $ is the slope and $ b $ is the y-intercept. \nSince the new line is parallel to $ y = 9x + 5 $, it must have the same slope, which is $ 9 $. \nGiven that the new line passes through $ (0, -8) $, the y-intercept is $ -8 $. \nThus, the equation of the new line is $ y = 9x - 8 $.",
