  "task": "Line t is defined by the equation $ 9y + -14x = 18 $. Line j is perpendicular to line t in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line j?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{-9}{14}",
    "B": "\\frac{9}{14}",
    "C": "\\frac{-14}{9}",
    "D": "\\frac{14}{9}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line t is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = \\frac{14}{9}x + b $. This means the slope of line t is \\frac{14}{9}. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of \\frac{14}{9} is \\frac{-9}{14}. Thus, the slope of line j is \\frac{-9}{14}.",
