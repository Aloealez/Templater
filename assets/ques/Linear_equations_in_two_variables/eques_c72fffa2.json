    "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = \\frac{5}{14}x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "\\frac{-5}{14}",
        "B": "\\frac{-14}{5}",
        "C": "\\frac{5}{14}",
        "D": "\\frac{1}{3}"

        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = \\frac{5}{14}x + b$, so its slope is $ \\frac{5}{14} $. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of $ \\frac{5}{14} $, which is \\frac{-14}{5}. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{-14}{5}.",
