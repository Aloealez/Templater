  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = 15/16x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "15/16",
    "B": "-15/16",
    "C": "15/17",
    "D": "-16/15"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = 15/16x + b$, so its slope is 15/16. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of 15/16, which is -16/15. Thus, the correct answer is -16/15.",
