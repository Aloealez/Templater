  "task": "A line passes through the points $(5, 19)$ and $(-12, 4)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "15/17",
    "B": "16/17",
    "C": "13/17",
    "D": "15/16"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $15/17$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \frac{4 - 19}{-12 - 5} = 15/17$. Thus, the correct answer is 15/17, or approximately 0.882 in decimal form.",
