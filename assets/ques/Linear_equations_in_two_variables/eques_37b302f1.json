  "task": "Sophia bought books and cupcakes for $114. Each books cost $5, and each cupcakes cost $1. If Sophia bought 9 books, how many cupcakes did Sophia buy?",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Sophia bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n$5 \times 9 = $45.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $114 - $45 = $69.\nSince each cupcakes costs $1, we divide: $69 รท $1 = 69.\nThus, Sophia bought 69 cupcakes.",
