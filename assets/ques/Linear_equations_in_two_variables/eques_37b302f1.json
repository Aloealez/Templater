    "task": "Sophia bought books and cupcakes for 114Dollars. Each books cost 5Dollars, and each cupcakes cost 1Dollars. If Sophia bought 9 books, how many cupcakes did Sophia buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Sophia bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n5Dollars times 9 = 45Dollars.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 114Dollars - 45Dollars = 69Dollars.\nSince each cupcakes costs 1Dollars, we divide: 69Dollars \u00f7 1Dollars = 69Dollars.\nThus, Sophia bought 69 cupcakes.",
