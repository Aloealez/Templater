    "task": "Sophia bought books and cupcakes for 114{dollars}. Each books cost 5{dollars}, and each cupcakes cost 1{dollars}. If Sophia bought 9 books, how many cupcakes did Sophia buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Sophia bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n5{dollars} \times 9 = 45{dollars}.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 114{dollars} - 45{dollars} = 69{dollars}.\nSince each cupcakes costs 1{dollars}, we divide: 69{dollars} \u00f7 1{dollars} = 69{dollars}.\nThus, Sophia bought 69 cupcakes.",
