    "task": "Anna is driving at a speed of 4 laps per hour and flying at a speed of 8 laps per hour. She spends $w$ hours driving and $r$ hours flying for a combined total of 12 laps. Which equation represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The total distance covered consists of two parts:\nThe distance covered while driving: $ 4 times w $.\nThe distance covered while flying: $ 8 times r $.\nSince the total distance covered is 12 laps, the equation becomes:\n$ 4w + 8r = 12 $.",
