  "task": "A line passes through the points $(16, -18)$ and $(8, -14)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "0/1",
    "B": "-3/2",
    "C": "-1/1",
    "D": "-1/2"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $-1/2$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \frac{-14 - -18}{8 - 16} = -1/2$. Thus, the correct answer is -1/2, or approximately -0.5 in decimal form.",
