  "task": "Line $ k $ is defined by $ y = 9x - 4 $. Line $ j $ is perpendicular to line $ k $ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $ j $?",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Since line $ j $ is perpendicular to line $ k $, its slope is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of line $ k $. \nThe equation for line $ k $ is given as $ y = 9x - 4 $, meaning its slope is $ 9 $. \nThe opposite reciprocal of $ 9 $ is $ -\frac{1}{9} $. \nThus, the slope of line $ j $ is $ -\frac{1}{9} $.",
