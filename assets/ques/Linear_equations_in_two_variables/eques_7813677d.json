    "task": "Liam bought party hats and pens for 115 Dollars. Each party hat costs 4 Dollars, and each pen costs 1 Dollar. If Liam bought 11 party hats, how many pens did Liam buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many pens Liam bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n$4 times 11 = $44.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $115 - $44 = $71.\nSince each pen costs $1, we divide: $71 รท $1 = 71.\nThus, Liam bought 71 pens.",
