    "task": "Liam bought party hats and pens for 115Dollars. Each party hats cost 4Dollars, and each pens cost 1Dollars. If Liam bought 11 party hats, how many pens did Liam buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many pens Liam bought, we first calculate the amount spent on party hats:\n$4 times 11 = $44.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $115 - $44 = $71.\nSince each pens costs $1, we divide: $71 \u00f7 $1 = 71.\nThus, Liam bought 71 pens.",
