  "task": "Wera is biking at a speed of 6 miles per hour and scooting at a speed of 9 miles per hour. She spends $ w $ hours biking and $ r $ hours scooting for a combined total of 23 miles. Which equation represents this situation?",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The total distance covered consists of two parts:\nThe distance covered while biking: $ 6 \times w $.\nThe distance covered while scooting: $ 9 \times r $.\nSince the total distance covered is 23 miles, the equation becomes:\n$ 6w + 9r = 23 $.",
