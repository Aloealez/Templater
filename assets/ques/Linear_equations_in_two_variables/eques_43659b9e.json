  "task": "Line m is defined by the equation $ 9y + -13x = 63 $. Line l is perpendicular to line m in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line l?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "9/13",
    "B": "-9/13",
    "C": "-13/9",
    "D": "13/9"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line m is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 13/9x + b $. This means the slope of line m is 13/9. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 13/9 is -9/13. Thus, the slope of line l is -9/13.",
