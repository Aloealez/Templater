  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = \\frac{-2}{1}x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\(\\frac{-2}{1}\\)",
    "B": "\\(\\frac{2}{1}\\)",
    "C": "\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)",
    "D": "\\(\\frac{-5}{3}\\)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = \\frac{-2}{1}x + b$, so its slope is $ \\frac{-2}{1} $. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of $ \\frac{-2}{1} $, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Thus, the correct answer is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
