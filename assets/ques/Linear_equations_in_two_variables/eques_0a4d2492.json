    "task": "Line $ k $ is defined by $ y = 10x + 9 $. Line $ j $ is perpendicular to line $ k $ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $ j $?",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since line $ j $ is perpendicular to line $ k $, its slope is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of line $ k $. \nThe equation for line $ k $ is given as $ y = 10x + 9 $, meaning its slope is $ 10 $. \nThe opposite reciprocal of $ 10 $ is $ -\\frac{1}{10} $. \nThus, the slope of line $ j $ is $ -\\frac{1}{10} $.",
