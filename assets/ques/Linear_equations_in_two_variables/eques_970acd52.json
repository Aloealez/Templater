    "task": "A line passes through the points $(13, -14)$ and $(-20, 6)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "\\frac{-19}{33}",
        "B": "\\frac{-20}{33}",
        "C": "\\frac{-5}{8}",
        "D": "\\frac{-6}{11}"

    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is $\\frac{-20}{33}$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \\frac{6 - -14}{-20 - 13} = \\frac{-20}{33}$. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{-20}{33}, or approximately -0.606 in decimal form.",
