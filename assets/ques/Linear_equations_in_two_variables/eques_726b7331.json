  "task": "Line s is defined by the equation $ 9y + -19x = 117 $. Line v is perpendicular to line s in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line v?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-9/19",
    "B": "-19/9",
    "C": "19/9",
    "D": "9/19"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line s is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 19/9x + b $. This means the slope of line s is 19/9. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 19/9 is -9/19. Thus, the slope of line v is -9/19.",
