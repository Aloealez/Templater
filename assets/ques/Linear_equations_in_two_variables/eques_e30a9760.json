  "task": "Line t is defined by the equation $ 1y + -11x = 6 $. Line r is perpendicular to line t in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line r?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1/11",
    "B": "-11",
    "C": "-1/11",
    "D": "11"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line t is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 11x + b $. This means the slope of line t is 11. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 11 is -1/11. Thus, the slope of line r is -1/11.",
