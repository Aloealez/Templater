    "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = \\frac{19}{12}x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$\\frac{19}{12}$",
        "B": "$\\frac{19}{13}$",
        "C": "$\\frac{-19}{12}$",
        "D": "$\\frac{-12}{19}$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = \\frac{19}{12}x + b$, so its slope is $ \\frac{19}{12} $. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of $ \\frac{19}{12} $, which is \\frac{-12}{19}. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{-12}{19}.",
