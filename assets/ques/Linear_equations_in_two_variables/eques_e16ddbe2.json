  "task": "A line passes through the points $(0, 3)$ and $(-4, -1)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "3/1",
    "B": "1/2",
    "C": "0/1",
    "D": "1/1"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $1/1$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \frac{-1 - 3}{-4 - 0} = 1$. Thus, the correct answer is 1/1, or approximately 1.0 in decimal form.",
