  "task": "A line passes through the points $(-20, -10)$ and $(11, -6)$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of the line?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "\\frac{4}{31}",
    "B": "\\frac{3}{31}",
    "C": "\\frac{1}{8}",
    "D": "\\frac{2}{31}"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is $\\frac{4}{31}$. For a line that passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope is calculated using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, $m = \\frac{-6 - -10}{11 - -20} = \\frac{4}{31}$. Thus, the correct answer is \\frac{4}{31}, or approximately 0.129 in decimal form.",
