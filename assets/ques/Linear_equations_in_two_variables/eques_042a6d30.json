  "task": "Emma is biking at a speed of 6 laps per hour and scooting at a speed of 10 laps per hour. She spends $ w $ hours biking and $ r $ hours scooting for a combined total of 14 laps. Which equation represents this situation?",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The total distance covered consists of two parts:\nThe distance covered while biking: $ 6 \times w $.\nThe distance covered while scooting: $ 10 \times r $.\nSince the total distance covered is 14 laps, the equation becomes:\n$ 6w + 10r = 14 $.",
