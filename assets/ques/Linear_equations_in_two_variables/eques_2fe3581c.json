  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = 4x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "3/1",
    "B": "-4/1",
    "C": "-1/4",
    "D": "4/1"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = 4x + b$, so its slope is 4. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of 4, which is -1/4. Thus, the correct answer is -1/4.",
