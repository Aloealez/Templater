  "task": "Daniel bought books and cupcakes for $104. Each books cost $4, and each cupcakes cost $3. If Daniel bought 11 books, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n$4 \times 11 = $44.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $104 - $44 = $60.\nSince each cupcakes costs $3, we divide: $60 \u00f7 $3 = 20.\nThus, Daniel bought 20 cupcakes.",
