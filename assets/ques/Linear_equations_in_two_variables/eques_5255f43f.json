    "task": "Daniel bought books and cupcakes for 104{dollars}. Each books cost 4, {dollars}and each cupcakes cost 3. {dollars}If Daniel bought 11 books, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n{dollars}4 times 11 = {dollars}44.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: {dollars}104 - {dollars}44 = {dollars}60.\nSince each cupcakes costs {dollars}3, we divide: {dollars}60 \u00f7 {dollars}3 = 20.\nThus, Daniel bought 20 cupcakes.",
