    "task": "Daniel bought books and cupcakes for 104 Dollars. Each book costs 4 Dollars and each cupcake costs 3 Dollars. If Daniel bought 11 books, how many cupcakes did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. To determine how many cupcakes Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on books:\n4 Dollars times 11 = 44 Dollars.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 104 Dollars - 44 Dollars = 60 Dollars.\nSince each cupcake costs 3 Dollars, we divide: 60 Dollars รท 3 Dollars = 20.\nThus, Daniel bought 20 cupcakes.",
