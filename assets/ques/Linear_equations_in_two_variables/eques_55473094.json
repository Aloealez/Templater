  "task": "a family's monthly budget for one year was $ x $ euros. The organization budgeted $ y $ euros for a specific category and 331 euros for other expenses. Which of the following represents the relationship between $ x $ and $ y $ in this context?",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The total budget is represented by $ x $, and $ y $ represents the allocated portion. The remaining amount is 331 euros. \nSince the total budget is $ x $, subtracting the allocated budget $ y $ gives us: \n$ x - y = 331 $, which correctly represents the relationship.",
