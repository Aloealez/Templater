  "task": "Daniel bought pencils and candles for $87. Each pencils cost $5, and each candles cost $3. If Daniel bought 15 pencils, how many candles did Daniel buy?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many candles Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on pencils:\n$5 \times 15 = $75.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $87 - $75 = $12.\nSince each candles costs $3, we divide: $12 ÷ $3 = 4.\nThus, Daniel bought 4 candles.",
