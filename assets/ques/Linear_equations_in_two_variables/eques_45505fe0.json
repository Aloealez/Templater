    "task": "Daniel bought pencils and candles for 87 Dollars. Each pencil costs 5 Dollars, and each candle costs 3 Dollars. If Daniel bought 15 pencils, how many candles did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many candles Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on pencils:\n5 Dollars times 15 = 75 Dollars.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: 87 Dollars - 75 Dollars = 12 Dollars.\nSince each candle costs 3 Dollars, we divide: 12 Dollars รท 3 Dollars = 4.\nThus, Daniel bought 4 candles.",
