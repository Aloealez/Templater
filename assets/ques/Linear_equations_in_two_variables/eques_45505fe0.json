    "task": "Daniel bought pencils and candles for87{dollars}. Each pencils cost 5{dollars}, and each candles cost 3{dollars}. If Daniel bought 15 pencils, how many candles did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many candles Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on pencils:\n{dollars}5 times 15 = {dollars}75.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: {dollars}87 - {dollars}75 = {dollars}12.\nSince each candles costs {dollars}3, we divide:\\ {dollars}12 \u00f7 {dollars}3 = {dollars}4.\nThus, Daniel bought 4 candles.",
