    "task": "Daniel bought pencils and candles for87Dollars. Each pencils cost 5Dollars, and each candles cost 3Dollars. If Daniel bought 15 pencils, how many candles did Daniel buy?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. To determine how many candles Daniel bought, we first calculate the amount spent on pencils:\nDollars5 times 15 = Dollars75.\nNext, we subtract this amount from the total cost: Dollars87 - Dollars75 = Dollars12.\nSince each candles costs Dollars3, we divide:\\ Dollars12 \u00f7 Dollars3 = Dollars4.\nThus, Daniel bought 4 candles.",
