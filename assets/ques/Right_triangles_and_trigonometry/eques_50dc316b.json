  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of 23 centimeters and 17 centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1\u221a818",
    "B": "8\u221a53",
    "C": "28",
    "D": "818"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a818. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(23)\u00b2 + (17)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n529 + 289 = 818 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a818 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a818 is 1\u221a818, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a818 cm.",
