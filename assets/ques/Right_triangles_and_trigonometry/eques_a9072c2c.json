  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 24 $ centimeters and $ 25 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 34 $",
    "B": "$ 5√48 $",
    "C": "$ 1201 $",
    "D": "1√1201"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√1201. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(24)² + (25)² = c²\n576 + 625 = 1201 = c²\nTaking the square root: √1201 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √1201 is 1√1201, so the hypotenuse is 1√1201 cm.",
