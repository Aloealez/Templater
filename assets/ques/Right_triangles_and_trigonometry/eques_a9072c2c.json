    "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 24 $ centimeters and $ 25 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$ 34 $",
        "B": "$ 5\u221a48 $",
        "C": "$ 1201 $",
        "D": "1\u221a1201"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a1201. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\\n(24)\u00b2 + (25)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\n576 + 625 = 1201 = c\u00b2\\nTaking the square root: \u221a1201 = c.\\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1201 is 1\u221a1201, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a1201 cm.",
