    "answers": {
        "A": "$34$",
        "B": "$5\u221a48$",
        "C": "$1201$",
        "D": "$\u221a1201$"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is \u221a1201. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(24)\u00b2 + (25)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n576 + 625 = 1201 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1201 = c.\nSo the hypotenuse is \u221a1201 cm.",
