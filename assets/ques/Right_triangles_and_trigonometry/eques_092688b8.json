  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 19 $ centimeters and $ 27 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 33 $",
    "B": "$ 1090 $",
    "C": "1√1090",
    "D": "$ 6√90 $"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√1090. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(19)² + (27)² = c²\n361 + 729 = 1090 = c²\nTaking the square root: √1090 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √1090 is 1√1090, so the hypotenuse is 1√1090 cm.",
