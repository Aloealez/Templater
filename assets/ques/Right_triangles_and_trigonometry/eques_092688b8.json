    "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 19 $ centimeters and $ 27 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$ 33 $",
        "B": "$ 1090 $",
        "C": "1\u221a1090",
        "D": "$ 6\u221a90 $"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a1090. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\\n(19)\u00b2 + (27)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\n361 + 729 = 1090 = c\u00b2\\nTaking the square root: \u221a1090 = c.\\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1090 is 1\u221a1090, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a1090 cm.",
