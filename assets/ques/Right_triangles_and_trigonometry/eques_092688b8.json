    "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $19$ centimeters and $27$ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$33$",
        "B": "$1090$",
        "C": "\u221a1090",
        "D": "$6\u221a90$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is \u221a1090. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(19)\u00b2 + (27)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n361 + 729 = 1090 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1090 = c.\nSo the hypotenuse is \u221a1090 cm.",
