    "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 25 $ centimeters and $ 26 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$ 1301 $",
        "B": "$ 8\u221a71 $",
        "C": "$ 36 $",
        "D": "1\u221a1301"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a1301. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\\n(25)\u00b2 + (26)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\n625 + 676 = 1301 = c\u00b2\\nTaking the square root: \u221a1301 = c.\\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1301 is 1\u221a1301, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a1301 cm.",
