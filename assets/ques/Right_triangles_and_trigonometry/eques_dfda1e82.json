  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 25 $ centimeters and $ 26 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 1301 $",
    "B": "$ 8√71 $",
    "C": "$ 36 $",
    "D": "1√1301"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√1301. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(25)² + (26)² = c²\n625 + 676 = 1301 = c²\nTaking the square root: √1301 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √1301 is 1√1301, so the hypotenuse is 1√1301 cm.",
