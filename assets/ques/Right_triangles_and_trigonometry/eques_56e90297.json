  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of 30 centimeters and 20 centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "36",
    "B": "8\u221a84",
    "C": "10\u221a13",
    "D": "1300"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 10\u221a13. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(30)\u00b2 + (20)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n900 + 400 = 1300 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1300 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1300 is 10\u221a13, so the hypotenuse is 10\u221a13 cm.",
