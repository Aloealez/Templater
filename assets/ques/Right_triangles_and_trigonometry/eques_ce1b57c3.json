  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of 19 centimeters and 22 centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "29",
    "B": "845",
    "C": "13\u221a5",
    "D": "3\u221a22"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 13\u221a5. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(19)\u00b2 + (22)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n361 + 484 = 845 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a845 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a845 is 13\u221a5, so the hypotenuse is 13\u221a5 cm.",
