  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 23 $ centimeters and $ 26 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 1205 $",
    "B": "1\u221a1205",
    "C": "$ 34 $",
    "D": "$ 5\u221a51 $"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a1205. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(23)\u00b2 + (26)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n529 + 676 = 1205 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1205 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1205 is 1\u221a1205, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a1205 cm.",
