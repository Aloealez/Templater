  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 23 $ centimeters and $ 26 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 1205 $",
    "B": "1√1205",
    "C": "$ 34 $",
    "D": "$ 5√51 $"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√1205. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(23)² + (26)² = c²\n529 + 676 = 1205 = c²\nTaking the square root: √1205 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √1205 is 1√1205, so the hypotenuse is 1√1205 cm.",
