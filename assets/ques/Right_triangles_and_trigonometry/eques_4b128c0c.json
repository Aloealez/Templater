    "answers": {
        "A": "$27$",
        "B": "$1\u221a761$",
        "C": "$761$",

        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 1\u221a761. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\\n(20)\u00b2 + (19)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\\n400 + 361 = 761 = c\u00b2\\nTaking the square root: \u221a761 = c.\\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a761 is 1\u221a761, so the hypotenuse is 1\u221a761 cm.",
