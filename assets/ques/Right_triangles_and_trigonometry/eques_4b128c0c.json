  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 20 $ centimeters and $ 19 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 27 $",
    "B": "1√761",
    "C": "$ 761 $",
    "D": "$ 6√97 $"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√761. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(20)² + (19)² = c²\n400 + 361 = 761 = c²\nTaking the square root: √761 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √761 is 1√761, so the hypotenuse is 1√761 cm.",
