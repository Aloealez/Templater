  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of 24 centimeters and 20 centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "4\u221a27",
    "B": "4\u221a61",
    "C": "31",
    "D": "976"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 4\u221a61. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(24)\u00b2 + (20)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n576 + 400 = 976 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a976 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a976 is 4\u221a61, so the hypotenuse is 4\u221a61 cm.",
