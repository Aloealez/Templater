  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $ 23 $ centimeters and $ 27 $ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$ 1258 $",
    "B": "1√1258",
    "C": "$ 9√47 $",
    "D": "$ 35 $"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1√1258. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(23)² + (27)² = c²\n529 + 729 = 1258 = c²\nTaking the square root: √1258 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of √1258 is 1√1258, so the hypotenuse is 1√1258 cm.",
