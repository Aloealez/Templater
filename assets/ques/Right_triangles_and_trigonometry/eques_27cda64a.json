    "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of $23$ centimeters and $27$ centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$1258$",
        "B": "$\u221a1258$",
        "C": "$9\u221a47$",
        "D": "$35$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is \u221a1258. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(23)\u00b2 + (27)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n529 + 729 = 1258 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1258 = c.\nSo the hypotenuse is \u221a1258 cm.",
