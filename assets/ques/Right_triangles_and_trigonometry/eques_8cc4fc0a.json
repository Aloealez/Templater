  "task": "A right triangle has legs with lengths of 28 centimeters and 21 centimeters. What is the length of this triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "8\u221a18",
    "B": "35",
    "C": "35",
    "D": "1225"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 35. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n(28)\u00b2 + (21)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n784 + 441 = 1225 = c\u00b2\nTaking the square root: \u221a1225 = c.\nThe simplified radical form of \u221a1225 is 35, so the hypotenuse is 35 cm.",
