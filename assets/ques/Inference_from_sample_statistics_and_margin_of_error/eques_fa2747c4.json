  "task": "From a population of 41573 people, 1097 were chosen at random and surveyed about a proposed piece of legislation. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 35% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 5%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "548",
    "B": "1097",
    "C": "13573",
    "D": "17455"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 35% of people in the population support a proposed piece of legislation, with a margin of error of 5%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 30% and 40% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (41573) gives a range of 12471 to 16629. Since 13573 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
