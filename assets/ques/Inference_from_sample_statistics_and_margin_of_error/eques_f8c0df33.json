  "task": "From a population of 84527 people, 1838 were chosen at random and surveyed about a new product launch. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 39% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 4%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "29691",
    "B": "1838",
    "C": "38163",
    "D": "919"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 39% of people in the population support a new product launch, with a margin of error of 4%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 35% and 43% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (84527) gives a range of 29584 to 36346. Since 29691 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
