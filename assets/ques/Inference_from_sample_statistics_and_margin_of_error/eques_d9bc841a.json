  "task": "From a population of 64357 people, 1502 were chosen at random and surveyed about a new product launch. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 25% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 3%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "18958",
    "B": "1502",
    "C": "751",
    "D": "15337"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 25% of people in the population support a new product launch, with a margin of error of 3%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 22% and 28% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (64357) gives a range of 14158 to 18019. Since 15337 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
