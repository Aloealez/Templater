  "task": "From a population of 62934 people, 1515 were chosen at random and surveyed about an election candidate. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 39% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 2%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "24116",
    "B": "1515",
    "C": "757",
    "D": "28613"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 39% of people in the population support an election candidate, with a margin of error of 2%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 37% and 41% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (62934) gives a range of 23285 to 25802. Since 24116 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
