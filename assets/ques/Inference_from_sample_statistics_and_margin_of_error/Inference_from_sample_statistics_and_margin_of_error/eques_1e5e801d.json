  "task": "From a population of 81487 people, 1858 were chosen at random and surveyed about a new school program. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 36% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 5%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1858",
    "B": "35371",
    "C": "929",
    "D": "27770"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 36% of people in the population support a new school program, with a margin of error of 5%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 31% and 41% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (81487) gives a range of 25260 to 33409. Since 27770 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
