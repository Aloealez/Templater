  "task": "From a population of 95266 people, 1682 were chosen at random and surveyed about a proposed piece of legislation. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 31% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 3%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "841",
    "B": "33566",
    "C": "30758",
    "D": "1682"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 31% of people in the population support a proposed piece of legislation, with a margin of error of 3%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 28% and 34% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (95266) gives a range of 26674 to 32390. Since 30758 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
