  "task": "In the given equation, $ a $ is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $ a $?\n\n$$ 2x + 18 = a(x + 9) $$",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nAn equation with one variable, $ x $, has infinitely many solutions only when both sides of the equation are equal for all values of $ x $. The given equation is:\n\n$ 2x + 18 = a(x + 9) $\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$ ax + a(9) = ax + 18 $\n\nFor the equation to have infinitely many solutions, the expressions on both sides must be identical. This means the coefficients of $ x $ and the constant terms must match:\n\n- Coefficients: $ 2 = a $  \u2192 **So, $ a = 2 $.**\n- Constant terms: $ 18 = 18 $, which is already true.\n\nThus, the correct value of $ a $ is **2**.",
