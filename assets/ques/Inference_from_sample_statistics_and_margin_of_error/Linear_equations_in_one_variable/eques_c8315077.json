  "question": "A rocket contained $406673$ kilograms (kg) of propellant before launch. Exactly $20$ seconds after launch, $352654$ kg of this propellant remained. On average, approximately how much propellant, in kg, did the rocket burn each second after launch?",
  "choices": {
    "A": 2700,
    "B": 3700,
    "C": 700,
    "D": 4700
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\nIt's given that the rocket contained $406673$ kg of propellant before launch and had $352654$ kg remaining after $20$ seconds.\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\n$406673 - 352654 = 54019$ kg burned in 20 seconds.\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\n $$ \\frac{54019}{20} = 2700') $$ kg per second.\nThus, the correct answer is **2700 kg per second**.",
