  "task": "In the given equation, $ b $ is a constant. If the equation has no solution, what is the value of $ b $?\n$$ (b - 2)x = 5 $$",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\n\nThis equation has no solution when there is no value of $ x $ that produces a true statement. Solving for $ x $ by dividing both sides by $ (b - 2) $ gives:\n\n$ x = \\frac{5}{b - 2} $\n\nWhen $ (b - 2) = 0 $, the denominator is zero, making the equation undefined. Thus, for no solution to exist, we set:\n\n$ b - 2 = 0 $\n\nSolving for $ b $ gives:\n\n$ b = 2 $\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution when $ b = 2 $.",
