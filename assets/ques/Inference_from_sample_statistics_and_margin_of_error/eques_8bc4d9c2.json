  "task": "From a population of 68273 people, 1166 were chosen at random and surveyed about a new product launch. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 30% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 5%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "583",
    "B": "1166",
    "C": "21631",
    "D": "26665"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 30% of people in the population support a new product launch, with a margin of error of 5%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 25% and 35% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (68273) gives a range of 17068 to 23895. Since 21631 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
