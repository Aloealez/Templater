    "task": "From a population of 81954 people, 1074 were chosen at random and surveyed about a new product launch. Based on the survey, it is estimated that 25% of people in the population support it, with an associated margin of error of 5%. Based on these results, which of the following is a plausible value for the total number of people in the population who support it?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "1074",
        "B": "19457",
        "C": "26033",
        "D": "16290"

        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "It's given that an estimated 25% of people in the population support a new product launch, with a margin of error of 5%. Subtracting and adding the margin of error from the estimate gives an interval of plausible values: between 20% and 30% of the population. Multiplying these percentages by the total population (81954) gives a range of 16390 to 24586. Since 19457 falls within this range, it is a plausible answer.",
