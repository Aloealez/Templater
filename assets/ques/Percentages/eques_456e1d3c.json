    "task": "The number $k$ is 30% greater than 49. If $k$ is the product of 49 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "-0.51",
        "B": "3.25",
        "C": "1.3",
        "D": "2.53"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since $k$ is 30% greater than 49, we calculate: $k = 49 + (30/100) \times 49$. This simplifies to $k = 63.7$. We also know $k = 49r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 63.7 / 49 = 1.3$.",
