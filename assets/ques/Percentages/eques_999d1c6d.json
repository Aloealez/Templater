  },

  "explanation": "Choice 1.46 is correct. \nThe number a is 70% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 70/100).\nThe number c is 14% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 14/100).\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\nc = b * (1 + 70/100) * (1 - 14/100).\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 70/100) * (1 - 14/100)) * 100.\nThis simplifies to 1.46%, which is the final answer.",
