    "task": "The number $k$ is 26% greater than 87. If $k$ is the product of 87 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "1.93",
        "B": "3.1",
        "C": "1.26",
        "D": "0.69"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since $k$ is 26% greater than 87, we calculate: $k = 87 + (26/100) \times 87$. This simplifies to $k = 109.62$. We also know $k = 87r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 109.62 / 87 = 1.26$.",
