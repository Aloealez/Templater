  "task": "The number $k$ is 48% greater than 57. If $k$ is the product of 57 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1.48",
    "B": "2.22",
    "C": "3.1",
    "D": "-0.06"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 48% greater than 57, we calculate: $k = 57 + (48/100) \times 57$. This simplifies to $k = 84.36$. We also know $k = 57r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 84.36 / 57 = 1.48$.",
