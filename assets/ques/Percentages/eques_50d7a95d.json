    "task": "The number $k$ is 16% greater than 67. If $k$ is the product of 67 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "1.16",
        "B": "2.84",
        "C": "0.1",
        "D": "3.02"

        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since $k$ is 16% greater than 67, we calculate: $k = 67 + (16/100) \times 67$. This simplifies to $k = 77.72$. We also know $k = 67r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 77.72 / 67 = 1.16$.",
