  "task": "The number $k$ is 10% greater than 89. If $k$ is the product of 89 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1.76",
    "B": "1.1",
    "C": "3.53",
    "D": "-0.11"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 10% greater than 89, we calculate: $k = 89 + (10/100) \times 89$. This simplifies to $k = 97.9$. We also know $k = 89r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 97.9 / 89 = 1.1$.",
