    "explanation": "Choice 0.39 is correct. \\nThe number a is 14% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 14/100).\\nThe number c is 66% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 66/100).\\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\\nc = b * (1 + 14/100) * (1 - 66/100).\\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 14/100) * (1 - 66/100)) * 100.\\nThis simplifies to 0.39%, which is the final answer.",
