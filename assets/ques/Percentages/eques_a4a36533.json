  "choices": {
    "A": 18.39,
    "B": 13.39,
    "C": 0.39,
    "D": 20.39
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "explanation": "Choice 0.39 is correct. \nThe number a is 14% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 14/100).\nThe number c is 66% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 66/100).\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\nc = b * (1 + 14/100) * (1 - 66/100).\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 14/100) * (1 - 66/100)) * 100.\nThis simplifies to 0.39%, which is the final answer.",
