    "task": "The number $k$ is 32% greater than 74. If $k$ is the product of 74 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "2.41",
        "B": "-0.23",
        "C": "3.21",
        "D": "1.32"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Since $k$ is 32% greater than 74, we calculate: $k = 74 + (32/100) \times 74$. This simplifies to $k = 97.68$. We also know $k = 74r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 97.68 / 74 = 1.32$.",
