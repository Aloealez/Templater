    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "explanation": "Choice 0.89 is correct. \nThe number a is 65% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 65/100).\nThe number c is 46% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 46/100).\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\nc = b * (1 + 65/100) * (1 - 46/100).\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 65/100) * (1 - 46/100)) * 100.\nThis simplifies to 0.89%, which is the final answer.",
