    "A": 1.67,
    "B": 14.67,
    "C": 0.67,
    "D": 3.67
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "explanation": "Choice 0.67 is correct. \nThe number a is 24% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 24/100).\nThe number c is 46% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 46/100).\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\nc = b * (1 + 24/100) * (1 - 46/100).\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 24/100) * (1 - 46/100)) * 100.\nThis simplifies to 0.67%, which is the final answer.",
