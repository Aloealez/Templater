  "task": "The number $k$ is 21% greater than 100. If $k$ is the product of 100 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-0.32",
    "B": "2.2",
    "C": "2.98",
    "D": "1.21"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 21% greater than 100, we calculate: $k = 100 + (21/100) \times 100$. This simplifies to $k = 121.0$. We also know $k = 100r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 121.0 / 100 = 1.21$.",
