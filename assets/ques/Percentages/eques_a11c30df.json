  "task": "The number $k$ is 28% greater than 75. If $k$ is the product of 75 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-0.59",
    "B": "1.28",
    "C": "3.06",
    "D": "3.28"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 28% greater than 75, we calculate: $k = 75 + (28/100) \times 75$. This simplifies to $k = 96.0$. We also know $k = 75r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 96.0 / 75 = 1.28$.",
