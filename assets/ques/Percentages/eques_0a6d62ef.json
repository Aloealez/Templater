  "task": "The number $k$ is 50% greater than 30. If $k$ is the product of 30 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-0.43",
    "B": "3.01",
    "C": "1.5",
    "D": "3.37"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 50% greater than 30, we calculate: $k = 30 + (50/100) \times 30$. This simplifies to $k = 45.0$. We also know $k = 30r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 45.0 / 30 = 1.5$.",
