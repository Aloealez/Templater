    "explanation": "Choice 0.65 is correct. \\nThe number a is 55% greater than b, which means a = b * (1 + 55/100).\\nThe number c is 58% less than a, which means c = a * (1 - 58/100).\\nSubstituting the expression for a into the expression for c gives:\\nc = b * (1 + 55/100) * (1 - 58/100).\\nTo find what percent c is of b, we calculate:\\n(c / b) * 100 = ((1 + 55/100) * (1 - 58/100)) * 100.\\nThis simplifies to 0.65%, which is the final answer.",
