  "task": "The number $k$ is 24% greater than 99. If $k$ is the product of 99 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1.24",
    "B": "2.87",
    "C": "0.22",
    "D": "2.23"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 24% greater than 99, we calculate: $k = 99 + (24/100) \times 99$. This simplifies to $k = 122.76$. We also know $k = 99r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 122.76 / 99 = 1.24$.",
