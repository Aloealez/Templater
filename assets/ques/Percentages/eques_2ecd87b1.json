  "task": "The number $k$ is 12% greater than 38. If $k$ is the product of 38 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-0.23",
    "B": "1.12",
    "C": "2.59",
    "D": "3.43"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since $k$ is 12% greater than 38, we calculate: $k = 38 + (12/100) \times 38$. This simplifies to $k = 42.56$. We also know $k = 38r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 42.56 / 38 = 1.12$.",
