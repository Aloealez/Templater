    "task": "The number $k$ is 48% greater than 69. If $k$ is the product of 69 and $r$, what is the value of $r$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "0.95",
        "B": "1.48",
        "C": "4.23",
        "D": "3.44"

        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since $k$ is 48% greater than 69, we calculate: $k = 69 + (48/100) \times 69$. This simplifies to $k = 102.12$. We also know $k = 69r$, so solving for $r$: $r = 102.12 / 69 = 1.48$.",
