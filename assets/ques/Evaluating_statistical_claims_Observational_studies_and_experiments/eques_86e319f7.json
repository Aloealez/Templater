    "task": "A survey was conducted using a sample of medical doctors selected at random from private colleges in New York. The surveyed individuals were asked about a specific topic related to their field. What is the largest population to which the results of the survey can be generalized?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "All medical doctors at private colleges in New York",
        "B": "All medical doctors in the United States",
        "C": "All professors in the United States",
        "D": "All professors at private colleges in New York"

        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The results of a survey can only be generalized to the population from which the sample was selected. Since the sample was drawn from medical doctors at private colleges in New York, the largest population to which the results can be generalized is 'All medical doctors at private colleges in New York'. The other answer choices are too broad and do not correctly represent the limits of the sample population.",
