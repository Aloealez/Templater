    "task": "A survey was conducted using a sample of engineers selected at random from public universities in Texas. The surveyed individuals were asked about a specific topic related to their field. What is the largest population to which the results of the survey can be generalized?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "All engineers at public universities in Texas",
        "B": "All professors at public universities in Texas",
        "C": "All engineers in the United States",
        "D": "All professors in the United States"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The results of a survey can only be generalized to the population from which the sample was selected. Since the sample was drawn from engineers at public universities in Texas, the largest population to which the results can be generalized is All engineers at public universities in Texas. The other answer choices are too broad and do not correctly represent the limits of the sample population.",
