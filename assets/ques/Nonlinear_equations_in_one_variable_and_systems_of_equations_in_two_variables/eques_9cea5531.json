    "task": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations below, which of the following could be the value of $x$?\\n$$ y = 4x + 3 $$\\n$$ y = x^2 + 2x + 1 $$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "3",
        "B": "6",
        "C": "5",
        "D": "1"

        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 4x + 3 = x^2 + 2x + 1 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-2)x + (-2) = 0 $. The discriminant is 12. Solving for $x$, we get possible values: [3, -1]. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making 3 the correct answer.",
