    "task": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations below, which of the following could be the value of $x$?\n$$ y = 4x + 1 $$\n$$ y = x^2 + 3x + -1 $$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "-1",
        "B": "0",
        "C": "4",
        "D": "2"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 4x + 1 = x^2 + 3x + -1 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-1)x + (-2) = 0 $. The discriminant is 9. Solving for $x$, we get possible values: [2, -1]. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making 2 the correct answer.",
