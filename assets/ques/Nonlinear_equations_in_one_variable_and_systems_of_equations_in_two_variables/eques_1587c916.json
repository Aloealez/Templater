  "task": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations below, which of the following could be the value of $x$?\\n$$ y = 4x + 4 $$\\n$$ y = x^2 + 3x + 2 $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "0",
    "B": "-2",
    "C": "-1",
    "D": "2"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 4x + 4 = x^2 + 3x + 2 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-1)x + (-2) = 0 $. The discriminant is 9. Solving for $x$, we get possible values: [2, -1]. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making -1 the correct answer.",
