  "task": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations below, which of the following could be the value of $x$?\\n$$ y = 5x + 2 $$\\n$$ y = x^2 + 3x + 3 $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-1",
    "B": "-2",
    "C": "1",
    "D": "3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 5x + 2 = x^2 + 3x + 3 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-2)x + (1) = 0 $. The discriminant is 0. Solving for $x$, we get possible values: [1]. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making 1 the correct answer.",
