    "answers": {
        "A": "4",
        "B": "2",
        "C": "-3",

        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 5x + 3 = x^2 + 3x + -3 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-2)x + (-6) = 0 $. The discriminant is 28. Solving for $x$, we get possible values 4 and -2. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making 4 the correct answer.",
