  "task": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations below, which of the following could be the value of $x$?\\n$$ y = 5x + 3 $$\\n$$ y = x^2 + 3x + -3 $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "4",
    "B": "2",
    "C": "3",
    "D": "6"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Setting the given equations equal to each other: $ 5x + 3 = x^2 + 3x + -3 $. Rearrange into quadratic form: $ x^2 + (-2)x + (-6) = 0 $. The discriminant is 28. Solving for $x$, we get possible values: [4, -2]. Only one of these values is listed as an answer choice, making 4 the correct answer.",
