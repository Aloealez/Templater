  "task": "During a annual marathon, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 2764 kilometers and a maximum of 4806 kilometers. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in kilometers, that Marek Bujanowicz traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "2764 ≤ d ≤ 4806",
    "B": "d ≤ 2764",
    "C": "d ≥ 4806",
    "D": "4806 ≤ d ≤ 6216"

  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that during a annual marathon, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 2764 kilometers and a maximum of 4806 kilometers. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 2764 ≤ d ≤ 4806.",
