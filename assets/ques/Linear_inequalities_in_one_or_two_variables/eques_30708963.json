  "task": "A certain tree weighs 124 inches at birth and gains more than 2.44 but less than 3.23 inches per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible inches values, $w$, for the tree after 293 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "789 < w < 1020",
    "B": "839 < w < 1070",
    "C": "671 < w < 856",
    "D": "939 < w < 1170"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The tree starts at 124 inches and grows between 2.44 and 3.23 inches per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 124 + 2.44 \times d < w < 124 + 3.23 \times d $. Substituting 293 for $d$ gives: $ 839 < w < 1070 $.",
