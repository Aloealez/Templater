  "task": "A certain child weighs 166 grams at birth and gains more than 1.09 but less than 2.04 grams per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible grams values, $w$, for the child after 385 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "536 < w < 901",
    "B": "686 < w < 1051",
    "C": "586 < w < 951",
    "D": "468 < w < 760"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The child starts at 166 grams and grows between 1.09 and 2.04 grams per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 166 + 1.09 \times d < w < 166 + 2.04 \times d $. Substituting 385 for $d$ gives: $ 586 < w < 951 $.",
