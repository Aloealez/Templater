    "task": "Steve Le plans to rent a jet ski. The rental cost is 23 Dollars per week, and he must also pay a fixed cost of 21 Dollars. Steve Le wants to spend no more than 348 Dollars. If the rental is available only for whole weeks, what is the maximum number of weeks Steve Le can rent a jet ski? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "23h + 21 > 348",
        "B": "23h < 348",
        "C": "23h + 21 < 348",
        "D": "23h + 31 < 348"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The equation 23h + 21 < 348 represents the given situation. Subtracting 21 from both sides and dividing by 23 gives h < 14. Since the rental is available only in whole weeks, the maximum weeks Steve Le can rent is 14.",
