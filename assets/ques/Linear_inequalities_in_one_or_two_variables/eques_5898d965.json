    "task": "Steve Le plans to rent a jet ski. The rental cost is Dollars23 per week, and he must also pay a fixed cost of Dollars21. Steve Le wants to spend no more than Dollars348. If the rental is available only for whole weeks, what is the maximum number of weeks Steve Le can rent a jet ski? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "23h + 21 \u2265 348",
        "B": "23h \u2264 348",
        "C": "23h + 21 \u2264 348",
        "D": "23h + 31 \u2264 348"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The equation 23h + 21 \u2264 348 represents the given situation. Subtracting 21 from both sides and dividing by 23 gives h \u2264 14. Since the rental is available only in whole weeks, the maximum weeks Steve Le can rent is 14.",
