  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 -3x + 4\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 1x + 3\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(2, 5)",
    "B": "(-4, -1)",
    "C": "(3, -2)",
    "D": "(5, 1)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 -3x + 4 and y \u2264 1x + 3, making (-4, -1) the correct choice.",
