  "task": "The minimum value of $x$ is 9 less than 5 times another number $n$. Which inequality shows the possible values of $x$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "x \u2265 9 - 5n",
    "B": "x \u2264 9 - 5n",
    "C": "x \u2264 5n - 9",
    "D": "x \u2265 5n - 9"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "Since the statement describes 9 less than 5 times n, we write 5n - 9 to express that relationship. If the statement mentions a minimum value, we use \u2265, and if it mentions a maximum, we use \u2264. Thus, the correct inequality is x \u2265 5n - 9.",
