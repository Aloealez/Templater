  "task": "On a cycling tour, Emily and Jessica each traveled for part of the trip, and the total distance they traveled was under 192 meters. Emily traveled at an average speed of 36 meters per hour, and Jessica traveled at an average speed of 51 meters per hour. Which of the following inequalities represents this situation, where $r$ is the number of hours Emily traveled and $j$ is the number of hours Jessica traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "36r + 51j > 192",
    "B": "36r + 51j < 192",
    "C": "51r + 36j > 192",
    "D": "51r + 36j < 192"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that Emily traveled at an average speed of 36 meters per hour and traveled for $r$ hours. Multiplying 36 by $r$ gives the distance Emily traveled: $36r$. Similarly, Jessica traveled at an average speed of 51 meters per hour for $j$ hours, yielding a distance of $51j$. The total distance must be less than 192, leading to the inequality $36r + 51j < 192$.",
