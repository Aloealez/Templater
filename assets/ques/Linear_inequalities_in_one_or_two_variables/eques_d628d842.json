  "task": "A certain child weighs 129 grams at birth and gains more than 4.64 but less than 6.28 grams per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible grams values, $w$, for the child after 353 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1717 < w < 2296",
    "B": "1867 < w < 2446",
    "C": "1413 < w < 1876",
    "D": "1767 < w < 2346"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The child starts at 129 grams and grows between 4.64 and 6.28 grams per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 129 + 4.64 \times d < w < 129 + 6.28 \times d $. Substituting 353 for $d$ gives: $ 1767 < w < 2346 $.",
