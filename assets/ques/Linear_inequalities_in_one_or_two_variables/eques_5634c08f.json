  "task": "A certain tree weighs 172 grams at birth and gains more than 3.36 but less than 4.53 grams per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible grams values, $w$, for the tree after 345 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1431 < w < 1835",
    "B": "1281 < w < 1685",
    "C": "1331 < w < 1735",
    "D": "1064 < w < 1388"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The tree starts at 172 grams and grows between 3.36 and 4.53 grams per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 172 + 3.36 \times d < w < 172 + 4.53 \times d $. Substituting 345 for $d$ gives: $ 1331 < w < 1735 $.",
