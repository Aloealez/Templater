  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 -2x + -6\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 0x + 10\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(3, 2)",
    "B": "(-2, 0)",
    "C": "(-1, 5)",
    "D": "(-5, 1)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 -2x + -6 and y \u2264 0x + 10, making (-5, 1) the correct choice.",
