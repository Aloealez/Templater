    "task": "Steve Le plans to rent a bike. The rental cost is Dollars100 per day, and he must also pay a fixed cost of Dollars22. Steve Le wants to spend no more than Dollars291. If the rental is available only for whole days, what is the maximum number of days Steve Le can rent a bike? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "100h + 22 \u2265 291",
        "B": "100h + 22 \u2264 291",
        "C": "100h \u2264 291",
        "D": "100h + 31 \u2264 291"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The equation 100h + 22 \u2264 291 represents the given situation. Subtracting 22 from both sides and dividing by 100 gives h \u2264 2. Since the rental is available only in whole days, the maximum days Steve Le can rent is 2.",
