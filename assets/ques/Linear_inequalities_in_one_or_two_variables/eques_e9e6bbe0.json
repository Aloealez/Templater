    "task": "Steve Le plans to rent a bike. The rental cost is 100 Dollars per day, and he must also pay a fixed cost of 22 Dollars. Steve Le wants to spend no more than 291 Dollars. If the rental is available only for whole days, what is the maximum number of days Steve Le can rent a bike? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "100h + 22 > 291",
        "B": "100h + 22 < 291",
        "C": "100h < 291",
        "D": "100h + 31 < 291"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The equation 100h + 22 < 291 represents the given situation. Subtracting 22 from both sides and dividing by 100 gives h < 2. Since the rental is available only in whole days, the maximum days Steve Le can rent is 2.",
