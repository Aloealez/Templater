    "task": "During a scientific expedition, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 2765 miles and a maximum of 4783 miles. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in miles, that Marek Bujanowicz traveled?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "d \u2264 2765",
        "B": "d \u2265 4783",
        "C": "4783 \u2264 d \u2264 6411",
        "D": "2765 \u2264 d \u2264 4783"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that during a scientific expedition, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 2765 miles and a maximum of 4783 miles. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 2765 \u2264 d \u2264 4783.",
