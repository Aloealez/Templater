    "task": "During a cross-country trip, Aleksander Iskra traveled a minimum of 2372 kilometers and a maximum of 2878 kilometers. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in kilometers, that Aleksander Iskra traveled?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "d \u2264 2372",
        "B": "d \u2265 2878",
        "C": "2878 \u2264 d \u2264 3494",
        "D": "2372 \u2264 d \u2264 2878"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that during a cross-country trip, Aleksander Iskra traveled a minimum of 2372 kilometers and a maximum of 2878 kilometers. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 2372 \u2264 d \u2264 2878.",
