  "task": "A certain puppy weighs 66 grams at birth and gains more than 2.28 but less than 3.79 grams per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible grams values, $w$, for the puppy after 360 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "709 < w < 1144",
    "B": "887 < w < 1430",
    "C": "987 < w < 1530",
    "D": "837 < w < 1380"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The puppy starts at 66 grams and grows between 2.28 and 3.79 grams per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 66 + 2.28 \times d < w < 66 + 3.79 \times d $. Substituting 360 for $d$ gives: $ 887 < w < 1430 $.",
