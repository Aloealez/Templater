    "task": "A certain plant weighs 120 kilograms at birth and gains more than 1.73 but less than 3.41 kilograms per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible kilograms values, $w$, for the plant after 324 days?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "681 < w < 1225",
        "B": "631 < w < 1175",
        "C": "544 < w < 980",
        "D": "781 < w < 1325"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The plant starts at 120 kilograms and grows between 1.73 and 3.41 kilograms per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 120 + 1.73 \times d < w < 120 + 3.41 \times d $. Substituting 324 for $d$ gives: $ 681 < w < 1225 $.",
