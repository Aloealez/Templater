  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$ y \u2264 -5x + -7\n $$$$ y \u2264 -3x + 13\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-2, 3)",
    "B": "(1, 5)",
    "C": "(5, -1)",
    "D": "(-1, 4)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both $ y \u2264 -5x + -7 $ and $ y \u2264 -3x + 13 $, making $ (-2, 3) $ the correct choice.",
