    "task": "During a annual marathon, Aleksander Iskra traveled a minimum of 2139 miles and a maximum of 2792 miles. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in miles, that Aleksander Iskra traveled?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "d \u2265 2792",
        "B": "d \u2264 2139",
        "C": "2792 \u2264 d \u2264 3543",
        "D": "2139 \u2264 d \u2264 2792"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that during a annual marathon, Aleksander Iskra traveled a minimum of 2139 miles and a maximum of 2792 miles. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 2139 \u2264 d \u2264 2792.",
