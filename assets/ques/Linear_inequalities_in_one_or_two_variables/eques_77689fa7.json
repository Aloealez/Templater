  "task": "During a spring migration, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 1647 kilometers and a maximum of 2674 kilometers. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in kilometers, that Marek Bujanowicz traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "d ≤ 1647",
    "B": "d ≥ 2674",
    "C": "2674 ≤ d ≤ 4332",
    "D": "1647 ≤ d ≤ 2674"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that during a spring migration, Marek Bujanowicz traveled a minimum of 1647 kilometers and a maximum of 2674 kilometers. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 1647 ≤ d ≤ 2674.",
