  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$ y ≤ 10x + -13\n $$$$ y ≤ -5x + 5\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(2, 0)",
    "B": "(-2, -1)",
    "C": "(2, -8)",
    "D": "(0, -5)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both $ y ≤ 10x + -13 $ and $ y ≤ -5x + 5 $, making $ (2, -8) $ the correct choice.",
