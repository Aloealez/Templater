  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 2x + -6\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 5x + 8\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(5, 4)",
    "B": "(-2, 1)",
    "C": "(0, -3)",
    "D": "(-2, -3)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 2x + -6 and y \u2264 5x + 8, making (5, 4) the correct choice.",
