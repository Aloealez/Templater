  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 3x + 2\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 1x + 1\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(3, 5)",
    "B": "(2, 0)",
    "C": "(-2, 2)",
    "D": "(-4, -5)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 3x + 2 and y \u2264 1x + 1, making (2, 0) the correct choice.",
