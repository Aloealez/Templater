  "task": "A certain child weighs 88 kilograms at birth and gains more than 4.06 but less than 5.63 kilograms per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible kilograms values, $w$, for the child after 232 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "824 < w < 1115",
    "B": "1130 < w < 1494",
    "C": "980 < w < 1344",
    "D": "1030 < w < 1394"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The child starts at 88 kilograms and grows between 4.06 and 5.63 kilograms per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 88 + 4.06 \times d < w < 88 + 5.63 \times d $. Substituting 232 for $d$ gives: $ 1030 < w < 1394 $.",
