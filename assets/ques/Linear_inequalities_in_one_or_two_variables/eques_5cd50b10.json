  "task": "A certain tree weighs 318 pounds at birth and gains more than 3.98 but less than 5.32 pounds per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible pounds values, $w$, for the tree after 201 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "894 < w < 1109",
    "B": "1068 < w < 1337",
    "C": "1218 < w < 1487",
    "D": "1118 < w < 1387"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The tree starts at 318 pounds and grows between 3.98 and 5.32 pounds per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 318 + 3.98 \times d < w < 318 + 5.32 \times d $. Substituting 201 for $d$ gives: $ 1118 < w < 1387 $.",
