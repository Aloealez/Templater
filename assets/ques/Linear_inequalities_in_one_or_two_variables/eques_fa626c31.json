  "task": "On a hiking expedition, Sophia and Jessica each traveled for part of the trip, and the total distance they traveled was under 405 miles. Sophia traveled at an average speed of 55 miles per hour, and Jessica traveled at an average speed of 32 miles per hour. Which of the following inequalities represents this situation, where $r$ is the number of hours Sophia traveled and $j$ is the number of hours Jessica traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "32r + 55j < 405",
    "B": "32r + 55j > 405",
    "C": "55r + 32j > 405",
    "D": "55r + 32j < 405"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that Sophia traveled at an average speed of 55 miles per hour and traveled for $r$ hours. Multiplying 55 by $r$ gives the distance Sophia traveled: $55r$. Similarly, Jessica traveled at an average speed of 32 miles per hour for $j$ hours, yielding a distance of $32j$. The total distance must be less than 405, leading to the inequality $55r + 32j < 405$.",
