  "task": "On a rowing competition, Sophia and Liam each traveled for part of the trip, and the total distance they traveled was under 197 miles. Sophia traveled at an average speed of 57 miles per hour, and Liam traveled at an average speed of 34 miles per hour. Which of the following inequalities represents this situation, where $r$ is the number of hours Sophia traveled and $j$ is the number of hours Liam traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "57r + 34j < 197",
    "B": "34r + 57j < 197",
    "C": "57r + 34j > 197",
    "D": "34r + 57j > 197"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "It's given that Sophia traveled at an average speed of 57 miles per hour and traveled for $r$ hours. Multiplying 57 by $r$ gives the distance Sophia traveled: $57r$. Similarly, Liam traveled at an average speed of 34 miles per hour for $j$ hours, yielding a distance of $34j$. The total distance must be less than 197, leading to the inequality $57r + 34j < 197$.",
