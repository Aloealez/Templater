  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 5x + 1\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 4x + 0\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-5, 3)",
    "B": "(-1, -3)",
    "C": "(1, -2)",
    "D": "(-1, 1)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 5x + 1 and y \u2264 4x + 0, making (1, -2) the correct choice.",
