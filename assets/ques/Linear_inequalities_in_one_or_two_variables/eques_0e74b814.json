    "task": "A certain tree weighs 102 inches at birth and gains more than 0.88 but less than 3.24 inches per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible inches values, $w$, for the tree after 286 days?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "354 < w < 1029",
        "B": "304 < w < 979",
        "C": "283 < w < 823",
        "D": "454 < w < 1129"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The tree starts at 102 inches and grows between 0.88 and 3.24 inches per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ (102 + 0.88) * d < w < (102 + 3.24) * d $. Substituting 286 for $d$ gives: $ 354 < w < 1029 $.",
