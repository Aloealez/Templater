    "task": "Steve Le plans to rent a bike. The rental cost is {dollars}40 per hour, and he must also pay a fixed cost of {dollars}8. Steve Le wants to spend no more than {dollars}385. If the rental is available only for whole hours, what is the maximum number of hours Steve Le can rent a bike? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "40h + 8 \u2265 385",
        "B": "40h + 18 \u2264 385",
        "C": "40h + 8 \u2264 385",
        "D": "40h \u2264 385"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The equation 40h + 8 \u2264 385 represents the given situation. Subtracting 8 from both sides and dividing by 40 gives h \u2264 9. Since the rental is available only in whole hours, the maximum hours Steve Le can rent is 9.",
