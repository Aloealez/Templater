  "task": "A certain plant weighs 448 inches at birth and gains more than 3.06 but less than 4.97 inches per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible inches values, $w$, for the plant after 308 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1390 < w < 1979",
    "B": "1112 < w < 1583",
    "C": "1490 < w < 2079",
    "D": "1340 < w < 1929"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The plant starts at 448 inches and grows between 3.06 and 4.97 inches per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 448 + 3.06 \times d < w < 448 + 4.97 \times d $. Substituting 308 for $d$ gives: $ 1390 < w < 1979 $.",
