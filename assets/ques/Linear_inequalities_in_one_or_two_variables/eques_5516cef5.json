    "task": "Max Ku plans to rent a jet ski. The rental cost is 28 Dollars per hour, and he must also pay a fixed cost of 10 Dollars. Max Ku wants to spend no more than 234 Dollars. If the rental is available only for whole hours, what is the maximum number of hours Max Ku can rent a jet ski? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "28h \u2264 234",
        "B": "28h + 10 \u2264 234",
        "C": "28h + 10 \u2265 234",
        "D": "28h + 17 \u2264 234"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The equation 28h + 10 \u2264 234 represents the given situation. Subtracting 10 from both sides and dividing by 28 gives h \u2264 8. Since the rental is available only in whole hours, the maximum hours Max Ku can rent is 8.",
