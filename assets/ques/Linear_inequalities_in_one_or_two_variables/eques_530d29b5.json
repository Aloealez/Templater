  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 -5x + -8\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 3x + -2\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(5, -2)",
    "B": "(-1, -5)",
    "C": "(-4, -1)",
    "D": "(0, 4)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 -5x + -8 and y \u2264 3x + -2, making (-1, -5) the correct choice.",
