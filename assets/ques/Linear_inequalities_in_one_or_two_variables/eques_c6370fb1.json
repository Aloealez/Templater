  "task": "A certain plant weighs 415 pounds at birth and gains more than 1.03 but less than 1.59 pounds per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible pounds values, $w$, for the plant after 255 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "542 < w < 656",
    "B": "678 < w < 820",
    "C": "778 < w < 920",
    "D": "628 < w < 770"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The plant starts at 415 pounds and grows between 1.03 and 1.59 pounds per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 415 + 1.03 \times d < w < 415 + 1.59 \times d $. Substituting 255 for $d$ gives: $ 678 < w < 820 $.",
