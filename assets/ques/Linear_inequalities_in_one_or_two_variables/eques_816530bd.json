  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$ y ≤ -10x + 10\n $$$$ y ≤ 1x + 11\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(2, 3)",
    "B": "(4, -1)",
    "C": "(4, -3)",
    "D": "(1, -5)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both $ y ≤ -10x + 10 $ and $ y ≤ 1x + 11 $, making $ (1, -5) $ the correct choice.",
