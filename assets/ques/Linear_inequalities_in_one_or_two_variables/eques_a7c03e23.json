  "task": "A certain puppy weighs 281 centimeters at birth and gains more than 2.15 but less than 2.85 centimeters per day during its first year. Which of the following inequalities represents all possible centimeters values, $w$, for the puppy after 232 days?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "624 < w < 753",
    "B": "730 < w < 892",
    "C": "880 < w < 1042",
    "D": "780 < w < 942"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The puppy starts at 281 centimeters and grows between 2.15 and 2.85 centimeters per day. The inequality describing this scenario is: $ 281 + 2.15 \times d < w < 281 + 2.85 \times d $. Substituting 232 for $d$ gives: $ 780 < w < 942 $.",
