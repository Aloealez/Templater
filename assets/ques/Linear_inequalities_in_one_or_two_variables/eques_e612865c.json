  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 1x + -9\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 0x + 4\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(5, 4)",
    "B": "(-2, -4)",
    "C": "(4, -5)",
    "D": "(4, -3)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 1x + -9 and y \u2264 0x + 4, making (4, -5) the correct choice.",
