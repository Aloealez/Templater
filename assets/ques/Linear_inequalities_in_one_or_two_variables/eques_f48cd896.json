  "task": "Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities?\n$$\ny \u2264 -5x + -5\n$$\n$$\ny \u2264 -3x + 2\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(3, -3)",
    "B": "(5, -1)",
    "C": "(2, -2)",
    "D": "(-3, 5)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The solutions to the system of inequalities are all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both inequalities. A correct solution satisfies both y \u2264 -5x + -5 and y \u2264 -3x + 2, making (-3, 5) the correct choice.",
