  "task": "During a annual marathon, Aleksander Piech traveled a minimum of 1443 meters and a maximum of 1962 meters. Which inequality represents this situation, where $d$ is a possible distance, in meters, that Aleksander Piech traveled?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "d ≤ 1443",
    "B": "d ≥ 1962",
    "C": "1443 ≤ d ≤ 1962",
    "D": "1962 ≤ d ≤ 2935"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. It's given that during a annual marathon, Aleksander Piech traveled a minimum of 1443 meters and a maximum of 1962 meters. Since $d$ represents the possible distance traveled, the correct inequality is 1443 ≤ d ≤ 1962.",
