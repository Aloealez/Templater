    "task": "Aleksander Iskra plans to rent a bike. The rental cost is {dollars}80 per month, and he must also pay a fixed cost of {dollars}25. Aleksander Iskra wants to spend no more than {dollars}419. If the rental is available only for whole months, what is the maximum number of months Aleksander Iskra can rent a bike? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "80h + 31 \u2264 419",
        "B": "80h + 25 \u2264 419",
        "C": "80h + 25 \u2265 419",
        "D": "80h \u2264 419"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The equation 80h + 25 \u2264 419 represents the given situation. Subtracting 25 from both sides and dividing by 80 gives h \u2264 4. Since the rental is available only in whole months, the maximum months Aleksander Iskra can rent is 4.",
