  "task": "Aleksander Iskra plans to rent a bike. The rental cost is $80 per month, and he must also pay a fixed cost of $25. Aleksander Iskra wants to spend no more than $419. If the rental is available only for whole months, what is the maximum number of months Aleksander Iskra can rent a bike? Which of the following equations properly represents this situation?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "80h + 31 ≤ 419",
    "B": "80h + 25 ≤ 419",
    "C": "80h + 25 ≥ 419",
    "D": "80h ≤ 419"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The equation 80h + 25 ≤ 419 represents the given situation. Subtracting 25 from both sides and dividing by 80 gives h ≤ 4. Since the rental is available only in whole months, the maximum months Aleksander Iskra can rent is 4.",
