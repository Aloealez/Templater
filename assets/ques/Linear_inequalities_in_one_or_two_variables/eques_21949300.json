    "task": "On a rowing competition, Emily and Liam each traveled for part of the trip, and the total distance they traveled was under 205 meters. Emily traveled at an average speed of 35 meters per hour, and Liam traveled at an average speed of 32 meters per hour. Which of the following inequalities represents this situation, where $r$ is the number of hours Emily traveled and $j$ is the number of hours Liam traveled?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "32r + 35j < 205",
        "B": "32r + 35j > 205",
        "C": "35r + 32j > 205",
        "D": "35r + 32j < 205"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "It's given that Emily traveled at an average speed of 35 meters per hour and traveled for $r$ hours. Multiplying 35 by $r$ gives the distance Emily traveled: $35r$. Similarly, Liam traveled at an average speed of 32 meters per hour for $j$ hours, yielding a distance of $32j$. The total distance must be less than 205, leading to the inequality $35r + 32j < 205$.",
