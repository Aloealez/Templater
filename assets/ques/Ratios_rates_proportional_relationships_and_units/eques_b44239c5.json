  "task": "The ratio 112 to $m$ is equivalent to the ratio 9 to 27. What is the value of $m$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "279",
    "B": "336",
    "C": "350",
    "D": "402"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\frac{112}{m} = \frac{9}{27}$. Cross multiplying gives: 112 \u00d7 27 = 9 \u00d7 m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 336$.",
