  "task": "The ratio 123 to $m$ is equivalent to the ratio 26 to 208. What is the value of $m$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "997",
    "B": "984",
    "C": "889",

  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\frac{123}{m} = \frac{26}{208}$. Cross multiplying gives: 123 \u00d7 208 = 26 \u00d7 m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 984$.",
