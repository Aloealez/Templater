  "task": "The ratio 85 to $m$ is equivalent to the ratio 45 to 135. What is the value of $m$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "255",
    "B": "336",
    "C": "383",
    "D": "243"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\frac{85}{m} = \frac{45}{135}$. Cross multiplying gives: 85 \u00d7 135 = 45 \u00d7 m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 255$.",
