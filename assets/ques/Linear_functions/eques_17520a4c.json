    "task": "According to a model, the head width, in inches, of a balloon can be estimated by adding 0.2 to 6 times the balloon's weight, in grams.\\nAccording to the model, what would be the head width, in inches, of a balloon that has a body weight of 1.1 grams?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\\nAccording to the model, the head width of a balloon can be estimated using the equation:\\n$ y = 0.2 + 6x $\\nLet $x$ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $y$ represent the head width, in inches.\\nSubstituting 1.1 grams for $x$:\\n$ y = 0.2 + 6(1.1) $\\n$ y = 0.2 + 6.6 $\\n$ y = 6.8 $\\nTherefore, a balloon with a body weight of 1.1 grams has an estimated head width of 6.8 inches.",
