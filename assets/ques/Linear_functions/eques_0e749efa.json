  "task": "The function $ h $ is defined by $ h(x) = 7x + 11 $. The graph of $ y = h(x) $ in the xy-plane has an x-intercept at $ (a, 0) $ and a y-intercept at $ (0, b) $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are constants. What is the value of $ a + b $? ",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nThe x-intercept of a graph is the point where $ y = 0 $. Given that the function is defined as:\n$ y = 7x + 11 $\n\nSetting $ y = 0 $:\n$ 0 = 7x + 11 $\nSolving for $ x $:\n$ x = -\\frac{11}{7} = -11/7 $\n\nThus, the x-intercept is $ (-11/7, 0) $.\n\nThe y-intercept occurs when $ x = 0 $:\n$ y = 7(0) + 11 = 11 $\n\nThus, the y-intercept is $ (0, 11) $.\n\nSince $ a = -11/7 $ and $ b = 11 $, the sum is:\n$ a + b = -11/7 + 11 = 66/7 $.",
