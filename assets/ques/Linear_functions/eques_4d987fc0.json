  "task": "According to a model, the height, in millimeters, of a balloon can be estimated by adding 0.8 to 5 times the balloon's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the height, in millimeters, of a balloon that has a body weight of 1.2 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the height of a balloon can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.8 + 5x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the height, in millimeters.\n\nSubstituting 1.2 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.8 + 5(1.2) $\n$ y = 0.8 + 6.0 $\n$ y = 6.8 $\n\nTherefore, a balloon with a body weight of 1.2 grams has an estimated height of 6.8 millimeters.",
