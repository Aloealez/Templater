  "task": "A veterinarian recommends that each day a certain rabbit should eat 16 calories per pound of the rabbit's weight plus an additional 11 calories. Which equation represents this situation, where $c$ is the total number of calories the veterinarian recommends the rabbit should eat each day if the rabbit's weight is $x$ pounds?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "c = 11x + 16",
    "B": "c = 21x",
    "C": "c = 16x + 11",
    "D": "c = 17x"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false

  "score": {
    "A": 0.0,
    "B": 0.0,
    "C": 1.0,
    "D": 0.0
  },
  "explanation": "The rabbit needs 16 calories for each pound it weighs, which is represented by 16x. Then, an additional 11 calories are added. So the equation is: $c = 16x + 11$.",
