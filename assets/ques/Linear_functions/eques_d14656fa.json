  "task": "A model predicts that a certain lion weighed 255 kilograms when it was born and that the lion gained 4 kilograms per weeks in its early life.\n\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted kilograms of the lion $ x $ weeks after birth, and $ a $ and $ b $ are constants.\n\nWhat is the value of $ a $? ",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\n\nFor a certain lion, it's given that a model predicts the lion weighed 255 kilograms when it was born and gained 4 kilograms per weeks in its early life.\n\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the lion after $ x $ weeks.\n- $ a $ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $ b $ represents the growth rate per weeks.\n\nSince $ a $ represents the weight of the lion at birth, the value of $ a $ is **255 kilograms**.",
