  "task": "According to a model, the length, in centimeters, of a bumblebee can be estimated by adding 0.5 to 4 times the bumblebee's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the length, in centimeters, of a bumblebee that has a body weight of 0.5 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the length of a bumblebee can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.5 + 4x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the length, in centimeters.\n\nSubstituting 0.5 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.5 + 4(0.5) $\n$ y = 0.5 + 2.0 $\n$ y = 2.5 $\n\nTherefore, a bumblebee with a body weight of 0.5 grams has an estimated length of 2.5 centimeters.",
