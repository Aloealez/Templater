    "task": "A veterinarian recommends that each day a certain rabbit should eat 30 calories per pound of the rabbit's weight plus an additional 13 calories. Which equation represents this situation, where $c$ is the total number of calories the veterinarian recommends the rabbit should eat each day if the rabbit's weight is $x$ pounds?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "c = 30x",
        "B": "c = 33x",
        "C": "c = 35x",
        "D": "c = 30x + 13"
    },

    },
    "explanation": "The rabbit needs 30 calories for each pound it weighs, which is represented by 30x. Then, an additional 13 calories are added. So the equation is: $c = 30x + 13$.",
