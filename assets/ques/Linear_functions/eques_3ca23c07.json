  "task": "A model predicts that a certain dog weighed 405 grams when it was born and that the dog gained 10 grams per months in its early life.\n\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted grams of the dog $ x $ months after birth, and $ a $ and $ b $ are constants.\n\nWhat is the value of $ a $? ",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nFor a certain dog, it's given that a model predicts the dog weighed 405 grams when it was born and gained 10 grams per months in its early life.\n\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the dog after $ x $ months.\n- $ a $ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $ b $ represents the growth rate per months.\n\nSince $ a $ represents the weight of the dog at birth, the value of $ a $ is **405 grams**.",
