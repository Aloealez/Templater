  "task": "The graph of a linear function f is shown, where y = f(x). What is the x-intercept of the graph of f?",
  "explanation": "The x-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the x-axis, i.e., where y = 0. Using the equation of the line y = 5x + (-4), we set y = 0 and solve for x: x = -(-4)/5 = 0.8. Thus, the correct answer is the x-intercept: (0.8, 0).",
