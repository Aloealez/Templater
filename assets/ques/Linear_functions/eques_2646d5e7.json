  "task": "According to a model, the wingspan, in meters, of a bird can be estimated by adding 0.8 to 6 times the bird's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the wingspan, in meters, of a bird that has a body weight of 0.9 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the wingspan of a bird can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.8 + 6x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the wingspan, in meters.\n\nSubstituting 0.9 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.8 + 6(0.9) $\n$ y = 0.8 + 5.4 $\n$ y = 6.2 $\n\nTherefore, a bird with a body weight of 0.9 grams has an estimated wingspan of 6.2 meters.",
