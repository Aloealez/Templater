  "task": "A veterinarian recommends that each day a certain rabbit should eat 40 calories per pound of the rabbit's weight plus an additional 13 calories. Which equation represents this situation, where $c$ is the total number of calories the veterinarian recommends the rabbit should eat each day if the rabbit's weight is $x$ pounds?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "c = 13x + 40",
    "B": "c = 45x",
    "C": "c = 40x",
    "D": "c = 40x + 13"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "score": {
    "A": 0.0,
    "B": 0.0,
    "C": 0.0,
    "D": 1.0
  },
  "explanation": "The rabbit needs 40 calories for each pound it weighs, which is represented by 40x. Then, an additional 13 calories are added. So the equation is: $c = 40x + 13$.",
