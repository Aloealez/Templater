    "task": "A model predicts that a certain horse weighed 340 pounds when it was born and that the horse gained 7 pounds per days in its early life.\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted pounds of the horse $ x $ days after birth, and $ a $ and $ b $ are constants.\nWhat is the value of $ a $? ",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\nFor a certain horse, it's given that a model predicts the horse weighed 340 pounds when it was born and gained 7 pounds per days in its early life.\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the horse after $ x $ days.\n- $ a $ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $ b $ represents the growth rate per days.\nSince $ a $ represents the weight of the horse at birth, the value of $ a $ is **340 pounds**.",
