    "task": "A model predicts that a certain panda weighed 391 pounds when it was born and that the panda gained 5 pounds per days in its early life.\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted pounds of the panda $x$ days after birth, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.\nWhat is the value of $a$? ",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\nFor a certain panda, it's given that a model predicts the panda weighed 391 pounds when it was born and gained 5 pounds per days in its early life.\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the panda after $x$ days.\n- $a$ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $b$ represents the growth rate per days.\nSince $a$ represents the weight of the panda at birth, the value of $a$ is 391 pounds.",
