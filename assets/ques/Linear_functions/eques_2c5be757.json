  "task": "According to a model, the head width, in centimeters, of a bird can be estimated by adding 1.5 to 6 times the bird's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the head width, in centimeters, of a bird that has a body weight of 0.4 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the head width of a bird can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 1.5 + 6x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the head width, in centimeters.\n\nSubstituting 0.4 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 1.5 + 6(0.4) $\n$ y = 1.5 + 2.4 $\n$ y = 3.9 $\n\nTherefore, a bird with a body weight of 0.4 grams has an estimated head width of 3.9 centimeters.",
