    "explanation": "It\u2019s given that the window repair specialist charges 208$ for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. \n Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours.\nSince it\u2019s given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression n(x \u2212 2). Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 220 + n(x \u2212 2).\n It\u2019s given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is 337$. Substituting 5 for x and 337 for f(x) into the equation f(x) = 208$ + n(x \u2212 2) yields\n 337 = 208 + n(5 \u2212 2), or 337 = 208 + 3n. Subtracting 208 from both sides of this equation yields \n129  = 3n. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields n = 43. Substituting 43 for n in the equation\nf(x) = 208 + n(x \u2212 2) yields f(x) =  208+ 43(x \u2212 2), which is equivalent to\n f(x) = 208 + 43x \u2212  86, or f(x) = 43x + 122. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 43x + 122.\n",
