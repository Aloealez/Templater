    "task": "The function $h$ is defined by $ h(x) = 3x + 15 $. The graph of $ y = h(x) $ in the xy-plane has an x-intercept at $ (a, 0) $ and a y-intercept at $ (0, b) $, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $ a + b $? ",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\\nThe x-intercept of a graph is the point where $ y = 0 $. Given that the function is defined as:\\n$ y = 3x + 15 $\\nSetting $ y = 0 $:\\n$ 0 = 3x + 15 $\\nSolving for $x$:\\n$ x = -\\frac{15}{3} = -5 $\\nThus, the x-intercept is $ (-5, 0) $.\\nThe y-intercept occurs when $ x = 0 $:\\n$ y = 3(0) + 15 = 15 $\\nThus, the y-intercept is $ (0, 15) $.\\nSince $ a = -5 $ and $ b = 15 $, the sum is:\\n$ a + b = -5 + 15 = 10 $.",
