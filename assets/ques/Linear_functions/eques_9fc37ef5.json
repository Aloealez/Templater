  "task": "According to a model, the head width, in centimeters, of a balloon can be estimated by adding 1.5 to 2 times the balloon's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the head width, in centimeters, of a balloon that has a body weight of 0.3 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the head width of a balloon can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 1.5 + 2x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the head width, in centimeters.\n\nSubstituting 0.3 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 1.5 + 2(0.3) $\n$ y = 1.5 + 0.6 $\n$ y = 2.1 $\n\nTherefore, a balloon with a body weight of 0.3 grams has an estimated head width of 2.1 centimeters.",
