  "explanation": "It’s given that the window repair specialist charges 230$ for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. \n Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours.\nSince it’s given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression n(x − 2). Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 220 + n(x − 2).\n It’s given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is 359$. Substituting 5 for x and 359 for f(x) into the equation f(x) = 230$ + n(x − 2) yields\n 359 = 230 + n(5 − 2), or 359 = 230 + 3n. Subtracting 230 from both sides of this equation yields \n129  = 3n. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields n = 43. Substituting 43 for n in the equation\nf(x) = 230 + n(x − 2) yields f(x) =  230+ 43(x − 2), which is equivalent to\n f(x) = 230 + 43x −  86, or f(x) = 43x + 144. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 43x + 144.\n",
