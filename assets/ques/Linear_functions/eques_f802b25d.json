  "task": "According to a model, the height, in meters, of a bumblebee can be estimated by adding 1.3 to 2 times the bumblebee's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the height, in meters, of a bumblebee that has a body weight of 1.1 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the height of a bumblebee can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 1.3 + 2x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the height, in meters.\n\nSubstituting 1.1 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 1.3 + 2(1.1) $\n$ y = 1.3 + 2.2 $\n$ y = 3.5 $\n\nTherefore, a bumblebee with a body weight of 1.1 grams has an estimated height of 3.5 meters.",
