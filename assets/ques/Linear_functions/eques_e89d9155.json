    "task": "According to a model, the wingspan, in inches, of a fish can be estimated by adding 0.4 to 7 times the fish's weight, in grams.\nAccording to the model, what would be the wingspan, in inches, of a fish that has a body weight of 1.3 grams?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\nAccording to the model, the wingspan of a fish can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.4 + 7x $\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the wingspan, in inches.\nSubstituting 1.3 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.4 + 7(1.3) $\n$ y = 0.4 + 9.1 $\n$ y = 9.5 $\nTherefore, a fish with a body weight of 1.3 grams has an estimated wingspan of 9.5 inches.",
