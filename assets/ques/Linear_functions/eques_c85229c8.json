  "task": "A model predicts that a certain whale weighed 359 pounds when it was born and that the whale gained 5 pounds per years in its early life.\n\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted pounds of the whale $ x $ years after birth, and $ a $ and $ b $ are constants.\n\nWhat is the value of $ a $? ",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nFor a certain whale, it's given that a model predicts the whale weighed 359 pounds when it was born and gained 5 pounds per years in its early life.\n\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the whale after $ x $ years.\n- $ a $ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $ b $ represents the growth rate per years.\n\nSince $ a $ represents the weight of the whale at birth, the value of $ a $ is **359 pounds**.",
