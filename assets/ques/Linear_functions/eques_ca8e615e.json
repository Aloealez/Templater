  "task": "According to a model, the length, in millimeters, of a bird can be estimated by adding 1.2 to 6 times the bird's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the length, in millimeters, of a bird that has a body weight of 0.5 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the length of a bird can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 1.2 + 6x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the length, in millimeters.\n\nSubstituting 0.5 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 1.2 + 6(0.5) $\n$ y = 1.2 + 3.0 $\n$ y = 4.2 $\n\nTherefore, a bird with a body weight of 0.5 grams has an estimated length of 4.2 millimeters.",
