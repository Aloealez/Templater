    "task": "According to a model, the head width, in inches, of a bumblebee can be estimated by adding 0.8 to 5 times the bumblebee's weight, in grams.\nAccording to the model, what would be the head width, in inches, of a bumblebee that has a body weight of 1.4 grams?",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\nAccording to the model, the head width of a bumblebee can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.8 + 5x $\nLet $x$ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $y$ represent the head width, in inches.\nSubstituting 1.4 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.8 + 5(1.4) $\n$ y = 0.8 + 7.0 $\n$ y = 7.8 $\nTherefore, a bumblebee with a body weight of 1.4 grams has an estimated head width of 7.8 inches.",
