  "task": "According to a model, the head width, in millimeters, of a bird can be estimated by adding 0.7 to 7 times the bird's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the head width, in millimeters, of a bird that has a body weight of 1.0 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the head width of a bird can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.7 + 7x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the head width, in millimeters.\n\nSubstituting 1.0 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.7 + 7(1.0) $\n$ y = 0.7 + 7.0 $\n$ y = 7.7 $\n\nTherefore, a bird with a body weight of 1.0 grams has an estimated head width of 7.7 millimeters.",
