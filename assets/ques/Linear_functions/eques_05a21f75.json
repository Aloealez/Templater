  "task": "According to a model, the height, in centimeters, of a fish can be estimated by adding 0.6 to 4 times the fish's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the height, in centimeters, of a fish that has a body weight of 1.3 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the height of a fish can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.6 + 4x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the height, in centimeters.\n\nSubstituting 1.3 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.6 + 4(1.3) $\n$ y = 0.6 + 5.2 $\n$ y = 5.8 $\n\nTherefore, a fish with a body weight of 1.3 grams has an estimated height of 5.8 centimeters.",
