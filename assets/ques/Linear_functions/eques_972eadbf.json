  "task": "According to a model, the length, in centimeters, of a bird can be estimated by adding 0.7 to 4 times the bird's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the length, in centimeters, of a bird that has a body weight of 0.7 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the length of a bird can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.7 + 4x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the length, in centimeters.\n\nSubstituting 0.7 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.7 + 4(0.7) $\n$ y = 0.7 + 2.8 $\n$ y = 3.5 $\n\nTherefore, a bird with a body weight of 0.7 grams has an estimated length of 3.5 centimeters.",
