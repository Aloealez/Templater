  "task": "According to a model, the length, in inches, of a balloon can be estimated by adding 0.5 to 4 times the balloon's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the length, in inches, of a balloon that has a body weight of 1.4 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the length of a balloon can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 0.5 + 4x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the length, in inches.\n\nSubstituting 1.4 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 0.5 + 4(1.4) $\n$ y = 0.5 + 5.6 $\n$ y = 6.1 $\n\nTherefore, a balloon with a body weight of 1.4 grams has an estimated length of 6.1 inches.",
