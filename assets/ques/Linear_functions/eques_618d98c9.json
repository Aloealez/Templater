  "task": "According to a model, the wingspan, in meters, of a bumblebee can be estimated by adding 1.1 to 5 times the bumblebee's weight, in grams.\n\nAccording to the model, what would be the wingspan, in meters, of a bumblebee that has a body weight of 1.3 grams?",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nAccording to the model, the wingspan of a bumblebee can be estimated using the equation:\n$ y = 1.1 + 5x $\n\nLet $ x $ represent the body weight, in grams, and let $ y $ represent the wingspan, in meters.\n\nSubstituting 1.3 grams for $ x $:\n$ y = 1.1 + 5(1.3) $\n$ y = 1.1 + 6.5 $\n$ y = 7.6 $\n\nTherefore, a bumblebee with a body weight of 1.3 grams has an estimated wingspan of 7.6 meters.",
