    "task": "A model predicts that a certain horse weighed 491 grams when it was born and that the horse gained 8 grams per months in its early life.\nThis model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where $ f(x) $ is the predicted grams of the horse $x$ months after birth, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.\nWhat is the value of $ a $? ",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\nFor a certain horse, it's given that a model predicts the horse weighed 491 grams when it was born and gained 8 grams per months in its early life.\nIt's also given that this model is defined by an equation in the form:\n$ f(x) = a + bx $, where:\n- $ f(x) $ is the predicted weight/size of the horse after $x$ months.\n- $a$ represents the initial weight/size at birth.\n- $b$ represents the growth rate per months.\nSince $a$ represents the weight of the horse at birth, the value of $a$ is 491 grams.",
