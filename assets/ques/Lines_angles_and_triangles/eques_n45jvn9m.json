    "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 15 feet tall and has a shadow that is 6 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 5 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
    "answers": {
        "A": "15.0",
        "B": "12.5",
        "C": "11.0",
        "D": "14.5"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 12.5. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is:\n15/6 = x/5.\nSolving for x gives: x = (15 \u00d7 5) / 6 = 12.5 feet.",
