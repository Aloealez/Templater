  "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 13 feet tall and has a shadow that is 7 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 1 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "5",
    "B": "3",
    "C": "1",
    "D": "3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 1. Each lamppost and its shadow form a right triangle. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is: 13/7 = x/1. Solving for x, we get x = (13 \u00d7 1) / 7 = 1 feet.",
