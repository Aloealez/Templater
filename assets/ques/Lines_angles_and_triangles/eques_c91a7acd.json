  "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 11 feet tall and has a shadow that is 5 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 1 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "2",
    "B": "4",
    "C": "4",
    "D": "7"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 2. Each lamppost and its shadow form a right triangle. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is: 11/5 = x/1. Solving for x, we get x = (11 \u00d7 1) / 5 = 2 feet.",
