  "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 13 feet tall and has a shadow that is 4 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 2 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "8",
    "B": "5",
    "C": "6",
    "D": "8"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 6. Each lamppost and its shadow form a right triangle. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is: 13/4 = x/2. Solving for x, we get x = (13 \u00d7 2) / 4 = 6 feet.",
