    "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 13 feet tall and has a shadow that is 4 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 1 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
    "answers": {
        "A": "3.25",
        "B": "5.25",
        "C": "4.25",
        "D": "4.75"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 3.25. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is:\n13/4 = x/1.\nSolving for x gives: x = (13 \u00d7 1) / 4 = 3.25 feet.",
