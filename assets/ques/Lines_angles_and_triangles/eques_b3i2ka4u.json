  "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 11 feet tall and has a shadow that is 4 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 3 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "9.75",
    "B": "8.25",
    "C": "7.25",
    "D": "6.75"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 8.25. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is:\n11/4 = x/3.\nSolving for x gives: x = (11 \u00d7 3) / 4 = 8.25 feet.",
