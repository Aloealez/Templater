    "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 11 feet tall and has a shadow that is 7 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 5 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
    "answers": {
        "A": "10.36",
        "B": "8.86",
        "C": "7.86",
        "D": "6.36"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 7.86. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is:\n11/7 = x/5.\nSolving for x gives: x = (11 \u00d7 5) / 7 = 7.86 feet.",
