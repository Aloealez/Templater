  "task": "Two nearby lampposts are perpendicular to the ground, which is flat. One of the lampposts is 15 feet tall and has a shadow that is 6 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of the other lamppost is 6 feet long. How tall, in feet, is the other lamppost? (Assume that at a given point in time, the right triangles formed by the lampposts and their respective shadows are similar.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "13",
    "B": "17",
    "C": "8",
    "D": "15"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 15. Each lamppost and its shadow form a right triangle. Since the triangles are similar, the proportion is: 15/6 = x/6. Solving for x, we get x = (15 \u00d7 6) / 6 = 15 feet.",
