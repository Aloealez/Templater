  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n-3x + -5y = 6\n$$\n$$\n5x + -8y = -6\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-107/98, -12/49)",
    "B": "(-12/49, -78/49)",
    "C": "(-78/49, 25/98)",
    "D": "(-78/49, -12/49)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -3 * -8 - -5 * 5 = 49, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-78/49, -12/49)$.",
