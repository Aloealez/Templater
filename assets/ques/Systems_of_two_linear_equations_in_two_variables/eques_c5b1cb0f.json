  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ 10x + 7y = 4\n $$$$ -10x -2y = 20\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-74/25, 53/10)",
    "B": "(24/5, -74/25)",
    "C": "(-74/25, 24/5)",
    "D": "(-123/50, 24/5)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 10 * -2 - 7 * -10 = 50, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-74/25, 24/5)$.",
