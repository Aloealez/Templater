  "task": "Janek is playing a virtual competition. In this game, players score points by collecting coins and stars. Each coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Janek played, he collected 29 coins and 10 stars, scoring 624 points. The second time, he collected 34 coins and 15 stars, scoring 769 points. Which system of equations can be used to determine the values of $c$ and $s$?",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Janek played a virtual competition where points are earned by collecting coins and stars.\nEach coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Janek played, he collected 29 coins and 10 stars, scoring 624 points.\nThe second time, Janek collected 34 coins and 15 stars, scoring 769 points.\nSetting up the system of equations, we have:\n$ 29c + 10s = 624 $\n$ 34c + 15s = 769 $\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
