    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\\n$ x + y = 25 $\\n$ x = 4y $\\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The second equation in the system is $ x = 4y $. Substituting $ 4y $ for $x$ in the first equation gives:\\n$ 4y + y = 25 $.\\nFactoring out $y$ results in:\\n$ (4 + 1)y = 25 $.\\nSolving for $y$, we divide by $ 4 + 1 $:\\n$ y = \\frac{25}{4 + 1} $.\\nSince we set $ y = 5 $, it checks out.\\nNow, substituting $ y = 5 $ into the second equation:\\n$ x = 4(5) $, so $ x = 20 $.\\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (20, 5) $.",
