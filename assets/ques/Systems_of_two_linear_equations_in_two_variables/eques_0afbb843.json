    "task": "Liam and Daniel purchased shirts and skirts from a store. The price of each shirt was the same, and the price of each skirt was the same. Liam purchased 6 shirts and 2 skirts for {dollars}126, and Daniel purchased 6 shirts and 4 skirts for {dollars}108. Which of the following systems of linear equations represents this situation, if $ x $ represents the price of each shirt and $ y $ represents the price of each skirt?",
    "explanation": [
        "Choice B is correct. The total cost of shirts and skirts purchased by Liam is modeled by the equation:\n$ 6x + 2y = 126 $.\nSimilarly, the total cost of shirts and skirts purchased by Daniel is:\n$ 6x + 4y = 108 $.\nThus, the correct system of equations is:\n$ 6x + 2y = 126 $",
        "$ 6x + 4y = 108 $."
