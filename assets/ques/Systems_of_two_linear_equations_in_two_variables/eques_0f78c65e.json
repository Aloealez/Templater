    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\\n$ x + y = 12 $\\n$ x = 5y $\\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The second equation in the system is $ x = 5y $. Substituting $ 5y $ for $x$ in the first equation gives:\\n$ 5y + y = 12 $.\\nFactoring out $y$ results in:\\n$ (5 + 1)y = 12 $.\\nSolving for $y$, we divide by $ 5 + 1 $:\\n$ y = \\frac{12}{5 + 1} $.\\nSince we set $ y = 2 $, it checks out.\\nNow, substituting $ y = 2 $ into the second equation:\\n$ x = 5(2) $, so $ x = 10 $.\\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (10, 2) $.",
