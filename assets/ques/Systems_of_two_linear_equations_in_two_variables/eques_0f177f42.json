    "answers": {
        "A": "$0$",
        "B": "$-1$",
        "C": "$\\frac{3}{2}$",
        "D": "$1$"

        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $4. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $0. Thus, the correct answer is $0$.",
