  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ 8x -1y = -4\n $$$$ -7x -8y = 4\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-36/71, -4/71)",
    "B": "(-1/142, -4/71)",
    "C": "(-36/71, 63/142)",
    "D": "(-4/71, -36/71)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 8 * -8 - (-1) * -7 = -71, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-36/71, -4/71)$.",
