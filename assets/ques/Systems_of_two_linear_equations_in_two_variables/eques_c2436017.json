    "task": "At how many points do the graphs of the equations $y = 10x -11$ and $y = -3x + 18$ intersect in the xy-plane?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "Infinite",
        "B": "0",
        "C": "2",
        "D": "1"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Each equation is written in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. If the slopes are different, the graphs will intersect at exactly one point. If the slopes are the same but the y-intercepts are different, the graphs are parallel and never intersect. If the slopes and y-intercepts are the same, the graphs are identical and have infinitely many intersection points. In some cases, depending on the system type, there may be exactly two intersections.",
