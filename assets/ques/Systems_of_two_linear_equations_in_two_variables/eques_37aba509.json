  "answers": {
    "A": "$8$",
    "B": "$10$",
    "C": "$11$",
    "D": "$9$"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $4. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $10. Thus, the correct answer is $10$.",
