  "answers": {
    "A": "-9",
    "B": "-11",
    "C": "-10",
    "D": "7"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 5}{2}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = -10$. Thus, the correct answer is -10.",
