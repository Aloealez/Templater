    "task": "Connor has $c$ tickets, and Maria has $m$ tickets. Connor has 3 times as many tickets as Maria, and together they have a total of 35 tickets. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Since Connor has 3 times as many tickets as Maria, we set up the equation:\\n$ c = 3m $.\\nSince together they have a total of 35 tickets, we set up:\\n$ c + m = 35 $.\\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
