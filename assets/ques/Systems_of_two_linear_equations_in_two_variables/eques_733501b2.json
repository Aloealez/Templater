    "task": "Connor has $c$ dollars, and Maria has $m$ dollars. Connor has 2 times as many dollars as Maria, and together they have a total of 35 dollars. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since Connor has 2 times as many dollars as Maria, we set up the equation:\\n$ c = 2m $.\\nSince together they have a total of 35 dollars, we set up:\\n$ c + m = 35 $.\\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
