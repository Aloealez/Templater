  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n6x + -4y = -14\n$$\n$$\n-3x + 6y = 15\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-1/2, 2)",
    "B": "(-1, 5/2)",
    "C": "(2, -1)",
    "D": "(-1, 2)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 6 * 6 - -4 * -3 = 24, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-1, 2)$.",
