    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\\n$ x + y = 40 $\\n$ x = 7y $\\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. The second equation in the system is $ x = 7y $. Substituting $ 7y $ for $x$ in the first equation gives:\\n$ 7y + y = 40 $.\\nFactoring out $y$ results in:\\n$ (7 + 1)y = 40 $.\\nSolving for $y$, we divide by $ 7 + 1 $:\\n$ y = \\frac{40}{7 + 1} $.\\nSince we set $ y = 5 $, it checks out.\\nNow, substituting $ y = 5 $ into the second equation:\\n$ x = 7(5) $, so $ x = 35 $.\\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (35, 5) $.",
