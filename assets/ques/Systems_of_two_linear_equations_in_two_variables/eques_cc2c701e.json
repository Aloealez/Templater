    "answers": {
        "A": "$(\\frac{13}{16}, \\frac{7}{8})$",
        "B": "$(\\frac{5}{16}, \\frac{7}{8})$",
        "C": "$(\\frac{5}{16}, \\frac{11}{8})$",

        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -10 * -1 - 7 * -10 = 80, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (5/16, 7/8)$.",
