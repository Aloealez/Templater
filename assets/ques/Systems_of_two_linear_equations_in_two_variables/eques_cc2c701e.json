    "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ -10x + 7y = 3\n $$$$ -10x -1y = -4\n $$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "(13/16, 7/8)",
        "B": "(5/16, 7/8)",
        "C": "(5/16, 11/8)",
        "D": "(7/8, 5/16)"

    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -10 * -1 - 7 * -10 = 80, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (5/16, 7/8)$.",
