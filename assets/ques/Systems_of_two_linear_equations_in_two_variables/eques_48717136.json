    "task": "Connor has $c$ marbles, and Maria has $m$ marbles. Connor has 2 times as many marbles as Maria, and together they have a total of 26 marbles. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Since Connor has 2 times as many marbles as Maria, we set up the equation:\n$ c = 2m $.\nSince together they have a total of 26 marbles, we set up:\n$ c + m = 26 $.\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
