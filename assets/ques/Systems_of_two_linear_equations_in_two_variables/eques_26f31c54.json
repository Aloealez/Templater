  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n\frac{-5}{2} y = 9\n$$\n$$\nx - \frac{2}{2} y = 4\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-3/5",
    "B": "2/5",
    "C": "7/5",
    "D": "9/4"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 9}{-5}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = 2/5$. Thus, the correct answer is 2/5.",
