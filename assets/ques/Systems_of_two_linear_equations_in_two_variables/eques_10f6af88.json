    "task": "Connor has $c$ tickets, and Maria has $m$ tickets. Connor has 4 times as many tickets as Maria, and together they have a total of 33 tickets. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Since Connor has 4 times as many tickets as Maria, we set up the equation:\\n$ c = 4m $.\\nSince together they have a total of 33 tickets, we set up:\\n$ c + m = 33 $.\\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
