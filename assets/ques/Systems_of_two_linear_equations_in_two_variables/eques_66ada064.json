    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\\n$ y = 14x -110 $\\n$ y = 30 $\\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The second equation in the system is $ y = 30 $. Substituting $ 30 $ for $y$ in the first equation gives:\\n$ 30 = 14x -110 $.\\nAdding $ 110 $ to both sides results in:\\n$ 140 = 14x $.\\nDividing by $ 14 $ gives $ x = 10 $.\\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (10, 30) $.",
