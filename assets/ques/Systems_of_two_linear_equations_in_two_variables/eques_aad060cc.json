  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ 6x + 8y = 11\n $$$$ 3x -10y = 20\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-29/28, 45/14)",
    "B": "(45/14, -15/28)",
    "C": "(45/14, -29/28)",
    "D": "(26/7, -29/28)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 6 * -10 - 8 * 3 = -84, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (45/14, -29/28)$.",
