    "task": "Daniel and Liam purchased pens and erasers from a store. The price of each pen was the same, and the price of each eraser was the same. Daniel purchased 6 pens and 5 erasers for 78 Dollars, and Liam purchased 3 pens and 3 erasers for 135 Dollars. Which of the following systems of linear equations represents this situation, if $x$ represents the price of each pen and $y$ represents the price of each eraser?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The total cost of pens and erasers purchased by Daniel is modeled by the equation:\n$ 6x + 5y = 78 $.\nSimilarly, the total cost of pens and erasers purchased by Liam is:\n$ 3x + 3y = 135 $.\nThus, the correct system of equations is:\n$ 6x + 5y = 78 $\n$ 3x + 3y = 135 $.",
