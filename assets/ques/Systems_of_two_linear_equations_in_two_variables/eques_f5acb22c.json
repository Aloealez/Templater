  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n-4x + -1y = 0\n$$\n$$\n-7x + 3y = 3\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(13/38, 12/19)",
    "B": "(-3/19, 12/19)",
    "C": "(-3/19, 43/38)",
    "D": "(12/19, -3/19)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -4 * 3 - -1 * -7 = -19, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-3/19, 12/19)$.",
