    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\\n$ y = 13x -43 $\\n$ y = 35 $\\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The second equation in the system is $ y = 35 $. Substituting $ 35 $ for $y$ in the first equation gives:\\n$ 35 = 13x -43 $.\\nAdding $ 43 $ to both sides results in:\\n$ 78 = 13x $.\\nDividing by $ 13 $ gives $ x = 6 $.\\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (6, 35) $.",
