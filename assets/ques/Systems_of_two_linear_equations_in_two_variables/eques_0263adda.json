    "task": "Connor has $c$ apples, and Maria has $m$ apples. Connor has 6 times as many apples as Maria, and together they have a total of 25 apples. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Since Connor has 6 times as many apples as Maria, we set up the equation:\n$ c = 6m $.\nSince together they have a total of 25 apples, we set up:\n$ c + m = 25 $.\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
