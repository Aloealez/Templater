  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ 8x -10y = 4\n $$$$ -1x -4y = 4\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-4/7, -5/14)",
    "B": "(-1/14, -6/7)",
    "C": "(-6/7, -4/7)",
    "D": "(-4/7, -6/7)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 8 * -4 - (-10) * -1 = -42, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-4/7, -6/7)$.",
