  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n\frac{-5}{2} y = 1\n$$\n$$\nx - \frac{3}{2} y = 8\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "32/5",
    "B": "37/5",
    "C": "5/2",
    "D": "42/5"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 1}{-5}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = 37/5$. Thus, the correct answer is 37/5.",
