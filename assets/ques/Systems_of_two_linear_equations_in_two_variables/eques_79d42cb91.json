  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{4}{2} y = -8$$\n$$x - \\frac{1}{2} y = -6$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$-8$",
    "B": "$-7$",
    "C": "$-9$",
    "D": "$\\frac{2}{3}$"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $-4. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $-8. Thus, the correct answer is $-8$.",
