  "task": "At how many points do the graphs of the equations $y = 4x + -20$ and $y = -3x + 7$ intersect in the xy-plane?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "2",
    "B": "1",
    "C": "Infinite",
    "D": "0"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Each equation is written in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. If the slopes are different, the graphs will intersect at exactly one point. If the slopes are the same but the y-intercepts are different, the graphs are parallel and never intersect. If the slopes and y-intercepts are the same, the graphs are identical and have infinitely many intersection points. In some cases, depending on the system type, there may be exactly two intersections.",
