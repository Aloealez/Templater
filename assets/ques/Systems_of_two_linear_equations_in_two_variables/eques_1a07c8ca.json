  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n\frac{-1}{2} y = 10\n$$\n$$\nx - \frac{2}{2} y = -4\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-23",
    "B": "-25",
    "C": "6/5",
    "D": "-24"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 10}{-1}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = -24$. Thus, the correct answer is -24.",
