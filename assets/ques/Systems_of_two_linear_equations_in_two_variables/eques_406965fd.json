  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n\frac{-4}{2} y = 1\n$$\n$$\nx - \frac{1}{2} y = -5\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-17/4",
    "B": "-21/4",
    "C": "5/4",
    "D": "-25/4"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 1}{-4}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = -21/4$. Thus, the correct answer is -21/4.",
