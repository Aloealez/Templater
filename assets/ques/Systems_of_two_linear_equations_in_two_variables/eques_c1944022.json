  "task": "Hiro and Daniel purchased chairs and tables from a store. The price of each chair was the same, and the price of each table was the same. Hiro purchased 4 chairs and 5 tables for Dollars89, and Daniel purchased 6 chairs and 3 tables for Dollars187. Which of the following systems of linear equations represents this situation, if $ x $ represents the price of each chair and $ y $ represents the price of each table?",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The total cost of chairs and tables purchased by Hiro is modeled by the equation:\n$ 4x + 5y = 89 $.\nSimilarly, the total cost of chairs and tables purchased by Daniel is:\n$ 6x + 3y = 187 $.\nThus, the correct system of equations is:\n$ 4x + 5y = 89 $\n$ 6x + 3y = 187 $.",
