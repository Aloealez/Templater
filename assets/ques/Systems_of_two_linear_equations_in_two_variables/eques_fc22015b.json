  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n-6x + 9y = 14\n$$\n$$\n6x + 5y = -17\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-181/84, -3/14)",
    "B": "(-3/14, -223/84)",
    "C": "(-223/84, 2/7)",
    "D": "(-223/84, -3/14)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -6 * 5 - 9 * 6 = -84, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-223/84, -3/14)$.",
