  "answers": {
    "A": "4/3",
    "B": "4",
    "C": "2",
    "D": "3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times 10}{-2}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = 3$. Thus, the correct answer is 3.",
