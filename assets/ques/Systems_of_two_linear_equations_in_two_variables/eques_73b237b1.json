    "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\\n$$\\frac{5}{2} y = -9$$\\n$$x - \\frac{1}{2} y = 7$$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "$6$",
        "B": "$\\frac{31}{5}$",
        "C": "$\\frac{26}{5}$",
        "D": "$\\frac{21}{5}$"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $\\frac{-18}{5}. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $\\frac{26}{5}. Thus, the correct answer is $\\frac{26}{5}$.",
