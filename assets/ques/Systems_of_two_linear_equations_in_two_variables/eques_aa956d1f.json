    "task": "Aleksander Piech is playing a video game. In this game, players score points by collecting coins and stars. Each coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Aleksander Piech played, he collected 21 coins and 6 stars, scoring 840 points. The second time, he collected 23 coins and 10 stars, scoring 979 points. Which system of equations can be used to determine the values of $c$ and $s$?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Aleksander Piech played a video game where points are earned by collecting coins and stars.\nEach coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Aleksander Piech played, he collected 21 coins and 6 stars, scoring 840 points.\nThe second time, Aleksander Piech collected 23 coins and 10 stars, scoring 979 points.\nSetting up the system of equations, we have:\n$ 21c + 6s = 840 $\n$ 23c + 10s = 979 $\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
