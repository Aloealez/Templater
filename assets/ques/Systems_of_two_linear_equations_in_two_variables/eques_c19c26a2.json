  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n $$ $$ \n$$\\frac{4}{2} y = -4$$\n$$x - \\frac{-4}{2} y = -5$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$-2$",
    "B": "$0$",
    "C": "$8$",
    "D": "$-1$"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $-2. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $-1. Thus, the correct answer is $-1$.",
