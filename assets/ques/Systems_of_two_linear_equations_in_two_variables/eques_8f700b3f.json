    "answers": {
        "A": "$6$",
        "B": "$4$",
        "C": "$\\frac{1}{3}$",
        "D": "$5$"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $-6. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $5. Thus, the correct answer is $5$.",
