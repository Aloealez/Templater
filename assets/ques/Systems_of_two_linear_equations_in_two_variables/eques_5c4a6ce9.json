  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n-3x + -7y = 0\n$$\n$$\n2x + -8y = -7\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-49/38, 21/38)",
    "B": "(21/38, -49/38)",
    "C": "(-49/38, 20/19)",
    "D": "(-15/19, 21/38)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -3 * -8 - -7 * 2 = 38, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-49/38, 21/38)$.",
