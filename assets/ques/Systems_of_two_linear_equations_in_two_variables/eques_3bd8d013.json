    "task": "Janek is playing an arcade challenge. In this game, players score points by collecting coins and stars. Each coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Janek played, he collected 28 coins and 7 stars, scoring 777 points. The second time, he collected 31 coins and 9 stars, scoring 909 points. Which system of equations can be used to determine the values of $c$ and $s$?",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Janek played an arcade challenge where points are earned by collecting coins and stars.\\nEach coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Janek played, he collected 28 coins and 7 stars, scoring 777 points.\\nThe second time, Janek collected 31 coins and 9 stars, scoring 909 points.\\nSetting up the system of equations, we have:\\n$ 28c + 7s = 777 $\\n$ 31c + 9s = 909 $\\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
