  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n10x + -5y = -14\n$$\n$$\n3x + -10y = 4\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-32/17, -79/170)",
    "B": "(-82/85, -32/17)",
    "C": "(-47/34, -82/85)",
    "D": "(-32/17, -82/85)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 10 * -10 - -5 * 3 = -85, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-32/17, -82/85)$.",
