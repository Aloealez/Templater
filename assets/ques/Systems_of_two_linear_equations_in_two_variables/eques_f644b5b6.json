  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$ -7x + 8y = -8\n $$$$ -3x -6y = 17\n $$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-4/3, -13/6)",
    "B": "(-5/6, -13/6)",
    "C": "(-13/6, -4/3)",
    "D": "(-4/3, -5/3)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -7 * -6 - 8 * -3 = 66, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-4/3, -13/6)$.",
