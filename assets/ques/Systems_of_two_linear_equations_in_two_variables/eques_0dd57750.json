  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n $$ $$ \n$$\\frac{-1}{2} y = 1$$\n$$x - \\frac{1}{2} y = -5$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$1$",
    "B": "$-6$",
    "C": "$-5$",
    "D": "$-7$"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = -2$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $-6. Thus, the correct answer is $-6$.",
