  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n6x + -10y = -5\n$$\n$$\n2x + -5y = -2\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(-1/2, 7/10)",
    "B": "(0, 1/5)",
    "C": "(-1/2, 1/5)",
    "D": "(1/5, -1/2)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as 6 * -5 - -10 * 2 = -10, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (-1/2, 1/5)$.",
