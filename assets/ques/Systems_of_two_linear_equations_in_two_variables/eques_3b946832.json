  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n$$\n\frac{-2}{2} y = -2\n$$\n$$\nx - \frac{5}{2} y = -7\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-3",
    "B": "8",
    "C": "-1",
    "D": "-2"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = \frac{2 \times -2}{-2}$. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = -2$. Thus, the correct answer is -2.",
