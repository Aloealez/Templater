  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $(x, y)$:\n$$\n-6x + -4y = 9\n$$\n$$\n-7x + -2y = 3\n$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "(3/8, -37/16)",
    "B": "(-45/16, 3/8)",
    "C": "(3/8, -45/16)",
    "D": "(7/8, -45/16)"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "We solve the system using elimination or substitution. The determinant is computed as -6 * -2 - -4 * -7 = -16, which is nonzero, so a unique solution exists. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $(x, y) = (3/8, -45/16)$.",
