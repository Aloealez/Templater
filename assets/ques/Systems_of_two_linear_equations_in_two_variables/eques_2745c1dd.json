    "task": "Daniel and Hiro purchased pens and erasers from a store. The price of each pen was the same, and the price of each eraser was the same. Daniel purchased 5 pens and 3 erasers for 80Dollars, and Hiro purchased 5 pens and 3 erasers for 100Dollars. Which of the following systems of linear equations represents this situation, if $ x $ represents the price of each pen and $ y $ represents the price of each eraser?",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The total cost of pens and erasers purchased by Daniel is modeled by the equation:\n$ 5x + 3y = 80 $.\nSimilarly, the total cost of pens and erasers purchased by Hiro is:\n$ 5x + 3y = 100 $.\nThus, the correct system of equations is:\n$ 5x + 3y = 80 $,\n$ 5x + 3y = 100 $.",
