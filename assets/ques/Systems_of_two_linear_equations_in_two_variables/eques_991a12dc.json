    "task": "Aleksander Piech is playing a virtual competition. In this game, players score points by collecting coins and stars. Each coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Aleksander Piech played, he collected 23 coins and 7 stars, scoring 637 points. The second time, he collected 32 coins and 8 stars, scoring 793 points. Which system of equations can be used to determine the values of $c$ and $s$?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Aleksander Piech played a virtual competition where points are earned by collecting coins and stars.\nEach coin is worth $c$ points, and each star is worth $s$ points. The first time Aleksander Piech played, he collected 23 coins and 7 stars, scoring 637 points.\nThe second time, Aleksander Piech collected 32 coins and 8 stars, scoring 793 points.\nSetting up the system of equations, we have:\n$ 23c + 7s = 637 $\n$ 32c + 8s = 793 $\nThis forms the correct system of equations.",
