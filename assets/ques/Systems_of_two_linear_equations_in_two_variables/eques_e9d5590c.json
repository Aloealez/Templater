    "task": "Solve the system of equations:\n$ x + y = 20 $\n$ x = 3y $\nWhat is the solution $ (x, y) $ to the system?",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The second equation in the system is $ x = 3y $. Substituting $ 3y $ for $ x $ in the first equation gives:\n$ 3y + y = 20 $.\nFactoring out $ y $ results in:\n$ (3 + 1)y = 20 $.\nSolving for $ y $, we divide by $ 3 + 1 $:\n$ y = \\frac{20}{3 + 1} $.\nSince we set $ y = 5 $, it checks out.\nNow, substituting $ y = 5 $ into the second equation:\n$ x = 3(5) $, so $ x = 15 $.\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $ (15, 5) $.",
