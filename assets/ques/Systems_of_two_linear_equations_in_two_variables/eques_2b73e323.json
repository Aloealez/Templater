  "task": "Solve the system of equations for $x$:\n $$ $$ \n$$\\frac{2}{2} y = 9$$\n$$x - \\frac{-5}{2} y = -7$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": "$\\frac{-61}{2}$",
    "B": "$\\frac{-57}{2}$",
    "C": "$\\frac{5}{4}$",
    "D": "$\\frac{-59}{2}$"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "First, solve for $y$ from the first equation: $y = $9. Substituting into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x = $\\frac{-59}{2}. Thus, the correct answer is $\\frac{-59}{2}$.",
