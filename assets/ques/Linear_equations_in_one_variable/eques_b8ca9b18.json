    "task": "In the given equation, $b$ is a constant. If the equation has no solution, what is the value of $b$?\\n$$(b - 1)x = 13$$",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\\nThis equation has no solution when there is no value of $x$ that produces a true statement. Solving for $x$ by dividing both sides by $ (b - 1) $ gives:\\n$ x = \\frac{13}{b - 1} $\\nWhen $ (b - 1) = 0 $, the denominator is zero, making the equation undefined. Thus, for no solution to exist, we set:\\n$ b - 1 = 0 $\\nSolving for $b$ gives:\\n$ b = 1 $\\nTherefore, the equation has no solution when $ b = 1 $.",
