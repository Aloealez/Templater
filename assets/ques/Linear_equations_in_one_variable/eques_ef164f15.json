  "question": "What value of $p$ satisfies the equation $2p + 40 = 28$?",
  "choices": {
    "A": -16,
    "B": -6,
    "C": -11,
    "D": 4
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides of the equation $2p + 40 = 28$ gives $2p = -12$.\nDividing both sides by 2 results in $1p = -6$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **-6**.",
