        "A": "-16",
        "B": "-6",
        "C": "-11",

        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation $2p + 40 = 28$ gives $2p = -12$.\nDividing both sides by 2 results in $p = -6$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is -6.",
