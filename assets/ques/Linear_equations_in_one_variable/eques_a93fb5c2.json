  "question": "In the given equation, $k$ is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $k$?\n\nEquation: $4x + k = 4x + 7$",
  "answers": {
    "A": 2,
    "B": 7,
    "C": -3,
    "D": 12
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\n\nFor the given equation $4x + k = 4x + 7$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be **identical**.\nSubtracting 4x from both sides results in $k = 7$.\nThus, the equation holds for **all** values of $x$ if and only if $k = 7$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **7**.",
