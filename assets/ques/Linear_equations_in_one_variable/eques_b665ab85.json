  "question": "A rocket contained $460770$ kilograms (kg) of propellant before launch. Exactly $26$ seconds after launch, $346035$ kg of this propellant remained. On average, approximately how much propellant, in kg, did the rocket burn each second after launch?",
  "answers": {
    "A": 5412,
    "B": 2412,
    "C": 4412,
    "D": 3412
  },
  "correct" : {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\nIt's given that the rocket contained $460770$ kg of propellant before launch and had $346035$ kg remaining after $26$ seconds.\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\n$460770 - 346035 = 114735$ kg burned in 26 seconds.\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\n $$ \\frac{114735}{26} = 4412') $$ kg per second.\nThus, the correct answer is **4412 kg per second**.",
