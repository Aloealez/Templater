    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "Rationale\\nIt's given that the rocket contained $467282$ kg of propellant before launch and had $343256$ kg remaining after $22$ seconds.\\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\\n$467282 - 343256 = 124026$ kg burned in 22 seconds.\\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\\n $$ \\frac{124026}{22} = 5637') $$ kg per second.\\nThus, the correct answer is 5637 kg per second.",
