  "task": "A vine had a height of 7 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($ n $) it took the vine to reach a height of 21 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 2 in this context?\n\n$ 2n + 7 = 21 $",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nThe height of the vine at a given time is equal to its initial height plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 21 represents the height at the final time, and 7 represents the height when it was first measured. It follows that 2n represents the total height growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 2 must represent the average number of units the vine's height increased per month.\n\n",
