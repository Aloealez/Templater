  "task": "A cactus had a circumference of 8 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many years ($ n $) it took the cactus to reach a circumference of 22 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 4 in this context?\n\n$ 4n + 8 = 22 $",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nThe circumference of the cactus at a given time is equal to its initial circumference plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 22 represents the circumference at the final time, and 8 represents the circumference when it was first measured. It follows that 4n represents the total circumference growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of years between the two measurements, the coefficient 4 must represent the average number of units the cactus's circumference increased per year.\n\n",
