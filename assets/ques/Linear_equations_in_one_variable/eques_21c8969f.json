    "task": "A rocket contained $426634$ kilograms (kg) of propellant before launch. Exactly $21$ seconds after launch, $337100$ kg of this propellant remained. On average, approximately how much propellant, in kg, did the rocket burn each second after launch?",
    "answers": {
        "A": 6263,
        "B": 3263,
        "C": 4263,
        "D": 2263
    },

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "**Rationale**\nIt's given that the rocket contained $426634$ kg of propellant before launch and had $337100$ kg remaining after $21$ seconds.\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\n$426634 - 337100 = 89534$ kg burned in 21 seconds.\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\n $$ \\frac{89534}{21} = 4263') $$ kg per second.\nThus, the correct answer is **4263 kg per second**.",
