    "task": "A bush had a circumference of 3 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($n$) it took the bush to reach a circumference of 16 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 1 in this context?\n$$1n + 3 = 16$$",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\nThe circumference of the bush at a given time is equal to its initial circumference plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 16 represents the circumference at the final time, and 3 represents the circumference when it was first measured. It follows that 1n represents the total circumference growth over time.\nSince $n$ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 1 must represent the average number of units the bush's circumference increased per month.\n",
