  "task": "Hector used a tool called an auger to remove corn from a storage bin at a constant rate. The bin contained 27,600 bushels of corn when Hector began to use the auger. After 3 hours of using the auger, 22,356 bushels of corn remained in the bin. If the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, what is the total number of hours Hector will have been using the auger when 10,212 bushels of corn remain in the bin?",

  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate removal rate\nRemoved in first period: 27,600 - 22,356 = 5,244 bushels\nRate: 5,244 ÷ 3 = 1,748 bushels/hour\n\nStep 2: Set up equation\nInitial amount - (rate × time) = remaining\n27,600 - 1,748x = 10,212\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\n27,600 - 10,212 = 1,748x\n17,388 ÷ 1,748 = 10 hours\n\nCommon mistakes:\n- Dividing remaining by rate: 10,212 ÷ 1,748 ≈ 1\n- Proportional time error: 3 × (37% ÷ 81%) ≈ 2\n- Incorrect rate calculation: Using wrong rate gives ≈ 6 hours",
