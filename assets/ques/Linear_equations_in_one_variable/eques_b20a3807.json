    "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\nThis equation has no solution when there is no value of $x$ that produces a true statement. Solving for $x$ by dividing both sides by $ (b - 2) $ gives:\n$ x = \\frac{5}{b - 2} $\nWhen $ (b - 2) = 0 $, the denominator is zero, making the equation undefined. Thus, for no solution to exist, we set:\n$ b - 2 = 0 $\nSolving for $b$ gives:\n$ b = 2 $\nTherefore, the equation has no solution when $ b = 2 $.",
