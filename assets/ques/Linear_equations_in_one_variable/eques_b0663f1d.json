  "task": "In the given equation, $ b $ is a constant. If the equation has no solution, what is the value of $ b $?\n\n$ (b - 5)x = 12 $",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nThis equation has no solution when there is no value of $ x $ that produces a true statement. Solving for $ x $ by dividing both sides by $ (b - 5) $ gives:\n\n$ x = \\frac{12}{b - 5} $\n\nWhen $ (b - 5) = 0 $, the denominator is zero, making the equation undefined. Thus, for no solution to exist, we set:\n\n$ b - 5 = 0 $\n\nSolving for $ b $ gives:\n\n$ b = 5 $\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution when $ b = 5 $.",
