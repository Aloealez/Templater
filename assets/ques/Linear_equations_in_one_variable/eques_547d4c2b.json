  "task": "A cactus had a height of 8 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($ n $) it took the cactus to reach a height of 14 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 4 in this context?\n\n$ 4n + 8 = 14 $",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\n\nThe height of the cactus at a given time is equal to its initial height plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 14 represents the height at the final time, and 8 represents the height when it was first measured. It follows that 4n represents the total height growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 4 must represent the average number of units the cactus's height increased per month.\n\n",
