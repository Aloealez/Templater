    "task": "What value of $p$ is the solution of the equation below?\\n$$1(p + 8) + 1(p - 4) = 4p$$",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\\nOne way to solve the equation $1(p + 8) + 1(p - 4) = 4p$ is to first distribute the terms outside the parentheses:\\n$$1p + 8 + 1p - 4 = 4p$$\\nNext, combine like terms on the left side:\\n$$(1p + 1p) + (8 - 4) = 4p$$\\n$$2p + 4 = 4p$$\\nSubtracting 2p from both sides:\\n$$4 = 4p - 2p$$\\n$$4 = (2)p$$\\nDividing both sides by 2:\\n$$p = \\frac{4}{2}$$\\nThus, the correct value of $p$ is $\\frac{2}{1}```````````$, which is equivalent to 2.00.",
