    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\nOne way to solve the equation $1(p + 8) + 1(p - 4) = 4p$ is to first distribute the terms outside the parentheses:\n$$1p + 8 + 1p - 4 = 4p$$\nNext, combine like terms on the left side:\n$$(1p + 1p) + (8 - 4) = 4p$$\n$$2p + 4 = 4p$$\nSubtracting 2p from both sides:\n$$4 = 4p - 2p$$\n$$4 = (2)p$$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$$p = \\frac{4}{2}$$\nThus, the correct value of $p$ is $\\frac{2}{1}$, which is equivalent to 2.00.",
