    "task": "A cactus had a height of 5 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many years ($n$) it took the cactus to reach a height of 14 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 3 in this context?\n$$3n + 5 = 14$$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "The average number of units the cactus's height increased per year.",
        "B": "The average number of years it takes similar cactuss to grow 14 units.",
        "C": "The height, in units, of the cactus when it was 1 year old.",
        "D": "The number of years it took the cactus to double its height."
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": true,
        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": false

        "A": 1.0,
        "B": 0.0,
        "C": 0.0,
        "D": 0.0
    },
   "explanation": "Choice A is correct.\nThe height of the cactus at a given time is equal to its initial height plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 14 represents the height at the final time, and 5 represents the height when it was first measured. It follows that 3n represents the total height growth over time.\nSince $n$ represents the number of years between the two measurements, the coefficient 3 must represent the average number of units the cactus's height increased per year.\n",
