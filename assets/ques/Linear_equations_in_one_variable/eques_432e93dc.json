    "task": "In the given equation, $a$ is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $a$?\n$$2x + 12 = a(x + 6)$$",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\nAn equation with one variable, $ x $, has infinitely many solutions only when both sides of the equation are equal for all values of $ x $. The given equation is:\n$ 2x + 12 = a(x + 6) $\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$ ax + a(6) = ax + 12 $\nFor the equation to have infinitely many solutions, the expressions on both sides must be identical. This means the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms must match:\n- Coefficients: $ 2 = a $  \u2192 So, $ a = 2 $.\n- Constant terms: $ 12 = 12 $, which is already true.\nThus, the correct value of $a$ is 2.",
