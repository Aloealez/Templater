  "question": "In the given equation, $k$ is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $k$?\n\nEquation: $2x + k = 2x + 0$",
  "answers": {
    "A": -10,
    "B": 5,
    "C": 10,
    "D": 0
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\n\nFor the given equation $2x + k = 2x + 0$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be **identical**.\nSubtracting 2x from both sides results in $k = 0$.\nThus, the equation holds for **all** values of $x$ if and only if $k = 0$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **0**.",
