    "explanation": "Rationale\\nFor the given equation $2x + k = 2x + 0$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be identical.\\nSubtracting 2x from both sides results in $k = 0$.\\nThus, the equation holds for all values of $x$ if and only if $k = 0$.\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0.",
