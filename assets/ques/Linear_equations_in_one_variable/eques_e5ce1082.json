    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "Rationale\nFor the given equation $2x + k = 2x$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be identical.\nSubtracting 2x from both sides results in $k = 0$.\nThus, the equation holds for all values of $x$ if and only if $k = 0$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0.",
