    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "Rationale\nIt's given that the rocket contained $427271$ kg of propellant before launch and had $345171$ kg remaining after $30$ seconds.\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\n$427271 - 345171 = 82100$ kg burned in 30 seconds.\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\n $$ \\frac{82100}{30} = 2736') $$ kg per second.\nThus, the correct answer is 2736 kg per second.",
