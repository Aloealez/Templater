    "task": "A flower had a weight of 4 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($n$) it took the flower to reach a weight of 13 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 5 in this context?\n$$5n + 4 = 13$$",
    "answers": {
        "A": "The number of months it took the flower to double its weight.",
        "B": "The weight, in units, of the flower when it was 1 month old.",
        "C": "The average number of units the flower's weight increased per month.",
        "D": "The average number of months it takes similar flowers to grow 13 units."
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "score": {
        "A": 0.0,
        "B": 0.0,
        "C": 1.0,
        "D": 0.0
    },
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\nThe weight of the flower at a given time is equal to its initial weight plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 13 represents the weight at the final time, and 4 represents the weight when it was first measured. It follows that 5n represents the total weight growth over time.\nSince $n$ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 5 must represent the average number of units the flower's weight increased per month.\n",
