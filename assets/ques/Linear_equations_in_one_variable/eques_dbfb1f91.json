  "task": "A flower had a weight of 4 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($ n $) it took the flower to reach a weight of 13 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 5 in this context?\n\n$$ 5n + 4 = 13 $$",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nThe weight of the flower at a given time is equal to its initial weight plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 13 represents the weight at the final time, and 4 represents the weight when it was first measured. It follows that 5n represents the total weight growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 5 must represent the average number of units the flower's weight increased per month.\n\n",
