  "task": "A plant had a circumference of 6 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many weeks ($ n $) it took the plant to reach a circumference of 15 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 2 in this context?\n\n$ 2n + 6 = 15 $",
  "explanation": "Choice C is correct.\n\nThe circumference of the plant at a given time is equal to its initial circumference plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 15 represents the circumference at the final time, and 6 represents the circumference when it was first measured. It follows that 2n represents the total circumference growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of weeks between the two measurements, the coefficient 2 must represent the average number of units the plant's circumference increased per week.\n\n",
