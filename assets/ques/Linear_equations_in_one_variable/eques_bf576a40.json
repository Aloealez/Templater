    "C": -61,
    "D": -67
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "\nRationale\nThe correct answer is -64. It's given that $5x - 9 = -24$. Multiplying each side of this equation by 3 yields $15x - 27 = -72$. Subtracting -8 from each side gives the final value of 15x - 19 = -64.",
