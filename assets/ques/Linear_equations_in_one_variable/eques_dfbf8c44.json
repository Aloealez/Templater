        "A": "-15",
        "B": "-5",

        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "For the given equation $8x + k = 8x -15$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be identical.\nSubtracting 8x from both sides results in $k = -15$.\nThus, the equation holds for all values of $x$ if and only if $k = -15$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is -15.",
