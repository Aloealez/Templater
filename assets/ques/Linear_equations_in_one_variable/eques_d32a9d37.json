    "explanation": "Choice D is correct.\nAn equation with one variable, $x$, has infinitely many solutions only when both sides of the equation are equal for all values of $x$. The given equation is:\n$ 4x + 20 = a(x + 5) $\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$ ax + a(5) = ax + 20 $\nFor the equation to have infinitely many solutions, the expressions on both sides must be identical. This means the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms must match:\n- Coefficients: $ 4 = a $  \u2192 So, $ a = 4 $.\n- Constant terms: $ 20 = 20 $, which is already true.\nThus, the correct value of $a$ is 4.",
