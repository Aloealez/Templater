  "task": "If x is the solution to the equation below, what is the value of x - 3?\n\n$ 3(2x - 4) - 6 = 4(x - 3) + 0 $",
  "explanation": "Expanding the left-hand side:\n$ 3(2x - 4) - 6 = 6x - 12 - 6 = 6x -18 $\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$ 4(x - 3) + 0 = 4x - 12 + 0 = 4x -12 $\n\nRewriting the equation:\n$ 6x -18 = 4x -12 $\n\nSubtracting 4x from both sides:\n$ 2x - 18 = -12 $\n$ 2x = 6 $\n$ x = 3 $\n\nSince we need to find $ x - 3 $, we compute:\n$ x - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 $\n\nBut with the original equation, if you solve for $ x $:\n$ 6x - 18 = 4x - 12 $\n$ 2x = 6 $\n$ x = 3 $\n$ x - 3 = 0 $\n\nIf your answer choices are as above, the correct answer is $ \\frac{0}{1} $. If you want $ \\frac{-6}{1} $, check your equation.",
