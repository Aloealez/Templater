        "A": "$3x + 10 = -24$",
        "B": "$3x + 7 = -16$",
        "C": "$3x + 10 = -14$",

        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "\\nRationale\\nChoice D is correct. Dividing each side of the given equation by 5 yields $3x + 5 = -19$. Therefore, the equation $3x + 5 = -19$ is equivalent to the given equation and has the same solution.",
