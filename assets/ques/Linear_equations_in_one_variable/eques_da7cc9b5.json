  "task": "A plant had a height of 4 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many weeks ($ n $) it took the plant to reach a height of 11 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 4 in this context?\n\n$ 4n + 4 = 11 $",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nThe height of the plant at a given time is equal to its initial height plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 11 represents the height at the final time, and 4 represents the height when it was first measured. It follows that 4n represents the total height growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of weeks between the two measurements, the coefficient 4 must represent the average number of units the plant's height increased per week.\n\n",
