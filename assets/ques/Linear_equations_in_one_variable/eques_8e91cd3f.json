  "task": "A cactus had a circumference of 6 units when it was first measured. The equation below can be used to find how many months ($ n $) it took the cactus to reach a circumference of 11 units. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 1 in this context?\n\n$$ 1n + 6 = 11 $$",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct.\n\nThe circumference of the cactus at a given time is equal to its initial circumference plus the number of units it grew. In the given equation, 11 represents the circumference at the final time, and 6 represents the circumference when it was first measured. It follows that 1n represents the total circumference growth over time.\n\nSince $ n $ represents the number of months between the two measurements, the coefficient 1 must represent the average number of units the cactus's circumference increased per month.\n\n",
