    "task": "In the given equation, $k$ is a constant. If the equation $6x + k = 6x + 12$ has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $k$? ",
    "answers": {
        "A": "12",
        "B": "22",
        "C": "2",

    },
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "explanation": "For the given equation $6x + k = 6x + 12$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be identical.\nSubtracting 6x from both sides results in $k = 12$.\nThus, the equation holds for all values of $x$ if and only if $k = 12$.",
