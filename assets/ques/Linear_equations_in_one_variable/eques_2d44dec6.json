  "task": "In the given equation, $k$ is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of $k$?\n$$10x + k = 10x -19$$",
  "answers": {
    "A": -9,
    "B": -4,
    "C": -19,
    "D": -29
  }, 
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\n\nFor the given equation $10x + k = 10x -19$ to have infinitely many solutions, both sides must be **identical**.\nSubtracting 10x from both sides results in $k = -19$.\nThus, the equation holds for **all** values of $x$ if and only if $k = -19$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **-19**.",
