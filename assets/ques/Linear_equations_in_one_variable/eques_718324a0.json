  "question": "A rocket contained $405162$ kilograms (kg) of propellant before launch. Exactly $25$ seconds after launch, $346935$ kg of this propellant remained. On average, approximately how much propellant, in kg, did the rocket burn each second after launch?",
  "answers": {
    "A": 1329,
    "B": 2329,
    "C": 329,
    "D": 3329
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "explanation": "**Rationale**\nIt's given that the rocket contained $405162$ kg of propellant before launch and had $346935$ kg remaining after $25$ seconds.\nFinding the difference between the initial and remaining fuel gives:\n$405162 - 346935 = 58227$ kg burned in 25 seconds.\nDividing by the number of seconds gives:\n $$ \\frac{58227}{25} = 2329') $$ kg per second.\nThus, the correct answer is **2329 kg per second**.",
