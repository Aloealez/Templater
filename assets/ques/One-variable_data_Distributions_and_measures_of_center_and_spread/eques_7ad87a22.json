  "task": "The numbers 10, 11, 11, 18, and $x$ are given. The mean and the median of these five numbers are equal. Which of the following is a possible value of $x$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "19",
    "B": "16",
    "C": "15",

  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "To satisfy the condition where mean and median are equal, $x$ must be chosen so that: the middle value (median) of the ordered set is equal to the mean (sum of all values divided by 5). For the given numbers [10, 11, 11, 18], the possible values of $x$ that satisfy this condition are: [5]. Since 5 satisfies this condition, it is the correct answer.",
