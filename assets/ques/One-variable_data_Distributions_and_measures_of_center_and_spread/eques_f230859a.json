    "task": "The numbers 14, 15, 15, 20, and $x$ are given. The mean and the median of these five numbers are equal. Which of the following is a possible value of $x$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "13",
        "B": "11",

        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "To satisfy the condition where mean and median are equal, $x$ must be chosen so that: the middle value (median) of the ordered set is equal to the mean (sum of all values divided by 5). For the given numbers [14, 15, 15, 20], the possible value of $x$ that satisfy this condition is 11. Since 11 satisfies this condition, it is the correct answer.",
