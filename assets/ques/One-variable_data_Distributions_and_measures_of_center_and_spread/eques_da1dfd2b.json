    "explanation": "To satisfy the condition where mean and median are equal, $x$ must be chosen so that: the middle value (median) of the ordered set is equal to the mean (sum of all values divided by 5). For the given numbers [10, 10, 18, 20], the possible values of $x$ that satisfy this condition are None. ",
