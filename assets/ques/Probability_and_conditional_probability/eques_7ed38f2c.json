  "task": "The ratio 21 to $m$ is equivalent to the ratio 22 to 176. What is the value of $m$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "291",
    "B": "168",
    "C": "131",
    "D": "193"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\frac{21}{m} = \\frac{22}{176}$. Cross multiplying gives: 21 × 176 = 22 × m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 168$.",
