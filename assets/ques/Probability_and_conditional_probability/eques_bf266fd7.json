    "answers": {
        "A": "1333",
        "B": "1251",

        "B": false,
        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\\frac{147}{m} = \\frac{34}{306}$. Cross multiplying gives: 147 \u00d7 306 = 34 \u00d7 m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 1323$.",
