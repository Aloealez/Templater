    "task": "In a bag, there are 6 orange cubes, 39 red cubes, 38 green cubes, and 34 yellow cubes. If one of these cubes is selected at random, what is the probability of selecting a cubes that is neither green nor yellow?",

        "A": "$\\frac{6}{117}$",
        "B": "$\\frac{45}{117}$",

    },
    "explanation": "There are a total of 117 cubes in the bag. If the cubes is neither green nor yellow, then it must be either orange or red. The probability of selecting one of these is (6 + 39)/117, which in LaTeX style is \\frac{45}{117}. Thus, the probability is \\frac{45}{117}.",
