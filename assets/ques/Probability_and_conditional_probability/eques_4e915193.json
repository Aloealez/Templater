    "task": "The ratio 108 to $m$ is equivalent to the ratio 7 to 14. What is the value of $m$?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "144",
        "B": "216",
        "C": "261",

        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since the two ratios are equivalent, we set up the proportion: $\\frac{108}{m} = \\frac{7}{14}$. Cross multiplying gives: 108 \u00d7 14 = 7 \u00d7 m. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 216$.",
