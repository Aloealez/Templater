    "task": "A rectangle has a length that is 19 times its width. The function $y = (19w)(w)$ represents this situation, where $y$ is the area of the rectangle, in square meters, and $y > 0$. Which of the following is the best interpretation of 19w in this context?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "The difference between the length and the width of the rectangle, in meters",
        "B": "The area of the rectangle, in square meters",
        "C": "The length of the rectangle, in meters",
        "D": "The width of the rectangle, in meters"
    },
    "correct": {
        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since the rectangle's length is 19 times its width, we define its length as 19w. This means that 19w represents the length of the rectangle, in meters.",
