    "task": "The numbers 11, 13, 14, 19, and $x$ are given. The mean and the median of these five numbers are equal. Which of the following is a possible value of $x$?",

    },
    "explanation": "To satisfy the condition where mean and median are equal, $x$ must be chosen so that: the middle value (median) of the ordered set is equal to the mean (sum of all values divided by 5). For the given numbers [11, 13, 14, 19], the possible values of $x$ that satisfy this condition is 8.",
