    "task": "A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. The function $y = (3w)(w)$ represents this situation, where $y$ is the area of the rectangle, in square inches, and $y > 0$. Which of the following is the best interpretation of 3w in this context?",
    "answers": {
        "A": "The width of the rectangle, in inches",
        "B": "The area of the rectangle, in square inches",
        "C": "The length of the rectangle, in inches",
        "D": "The difference between the length and the width of the rectangle, in inches"

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "Since the rectangle's length is 3 times its width, we define its length as 3w. This means that 3w represents the length of the rectangle, in inches.",
