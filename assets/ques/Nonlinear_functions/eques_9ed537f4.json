  "task": "A rectangle has a length that is 7 times its width. The function $y = (7w)(w)$ represents this situation, where $y$ is the area of the rectangle, in square feet, and $y > 0$. Which of the following is the best interpretation of 7w in this context?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "The length of the rectangle, in feet",
    "B": "The difference between the length and the width of the rectangle, in feet",
    "C": "The area of the rectangle, in square feet",
    "D": "The width of the rectangle, in feet"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the rectangle's length is 7 times its width, we define its length as 7w. This means that 7w represents the length of the rectangle, in feet.",
