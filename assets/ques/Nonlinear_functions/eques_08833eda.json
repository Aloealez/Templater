    "task": "The numbers 10, 11, 11, 20, and $x$ are given. The mean and the median of these five numbers are equal. Which of the following is a possible value of $x$?",

        "A": "12",
        "B": "11",

        "C": false,
        "D": true
    },
    "explanation": "To satisfy the condition where mean and median are equal, $x$ must be chosen so that: the middle value (median) of the ordered set is equal to the mean (sum of all values divided by 5). For the given numbers [10, 11, 11, 20], the possible values of $x$ that satisfy this condition are none.",
