  "task": "A rectangle has a length that is 11 times its width. The function $y = (11w)(w)$ represents this situation, where $y$ is the area of the rectangle, in square centimeters, and $y > 0$. Which of the following is the best interpretation of 11w in this context?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "The length of the rectangle, in centimeters",
    "B": "The width of the rectangle, in centimeters",
    "C": "The area of the rectangle, in square centimeters",
    "D": "The difference between the length and the width of the rectangle, in centimeters"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "Since the rectangle's length is 11 times its width, we define its length as 11w. This means that 11w represents the length of the rectangle, in centimeters.",
