  "task": "In the given scatterplot, a line of best fit for the data is shown. Which of the following is closest to the slope of the line of best fit shown?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "3.61",
    "B": "0.47",
    "C": "2.13",

  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(x_1, 0.7)$ and $(x_2, 8.0)$. Computing the slope: $m = \frac{8.0 - 0.7}{5 - 0} = 1.47$. Thus, the closest answer choice is 1.47.",
