  "task": "Line q is defined by the equation $ 3y + -9x = 24 $. Line v is perpendicular to line q in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line v?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "1/3",
    "B": "-3",
    "C": "-1/3",
    "D": "3"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The given equation of line q is rewritten in slope-intercept form as $ y = 3x + b $. This means the slope of line q is 3. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of 3 is -1/3. Thus, the slope of line v is -1/3.",
