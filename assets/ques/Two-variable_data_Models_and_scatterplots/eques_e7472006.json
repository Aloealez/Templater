    "A": "1.88",
    "B": "4.05",

    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(x_1, 0.6)$ and $(x_2, 10.0)$. Computing the slope: $m = \frac{10.0 - 0.6}{5 - 0} = 1.88$. Thus, the closest answer choice is 1.88.",
