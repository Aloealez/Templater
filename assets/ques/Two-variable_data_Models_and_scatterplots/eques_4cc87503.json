        "A": "1.61",

    },
    "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(x_1, 0.4)$ and $(x_2, 8.4)$. Computing the slope: $m = \\frac{8.4 - 0.4}{5 - 0} = 1.61$. Thus, the closest answer choice is 1.61.",
