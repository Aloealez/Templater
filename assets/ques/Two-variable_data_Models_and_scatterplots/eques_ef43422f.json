  "task": "In the given scatterplot, a line of best fit for the data is shown. Which of the following is closest to the slope of the line of best fit shown?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "3.58",
    "B": "1.68",
    "C": "0.97",

  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(x_1, 0.7)$ and $(x_2, 9.1)$. Computing the slope: $m = \frac{9.1 - 0.7}{5 - 0} = 1.68$. Thus, the closest answer choice is 1.68.",
