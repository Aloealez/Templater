  "task": "Line $k$ is defined by the equation $y = -9/16x + b$. Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "-9/17",
    "B": "9/16",
    "C": "-9/16",
    "D": "16/9"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The equation of line $k$ is given as $y = -9/16x + b$, so its slope is -9/16. For a perpendicular line, the slope is the negative reciprocal of -9/16, which is 16/9. Thus, the correct answer is 16/9.",
