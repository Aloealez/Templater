  "task": "In the given scatterplot, a line of best fit for the data is shown. Which of the following is closest to the slope of the line of best fit shown?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "2.58",
    "B": "1.84",
    "C": "1.22",

  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": true,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(x_1, 0.5)$ and $(x_2, 9.7)$. Computing the slope: $m = \\frac{9.7 - 0.5}{5 - 0} = 1.84$. Thus, the closest answer choice is 1.84.",
