        "A": "3.86",

    },
    "explanation": "A line in the xy-plane that passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has a slope of $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The line of best fit shown passes through approximately $(0, 1.0)$ and $(5, 9.6)$. Computing the slope: $m = \\frac{9.6 - 1.0}{5 - 0} = 1.72$. Thus, the answer is 1.72.",
