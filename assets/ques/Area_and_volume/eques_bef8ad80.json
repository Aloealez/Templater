  "task": "A triangular prism has a height of 7 centimeters (cm) and a volume of 70 cm³. What is the area, in cm², of the base of the prism? (The volume of a triangular prism is equal to B × h, where B is the area of the base and h is the height of the prism.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "34",
    "B": "7",
    "C": "13",
    "D": "10"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 10. The volume of a triangular prism is given by V = B × h. Since the volume is 70 cm³ and the height is 7 cm, we solve for B: 70 = B × 7. Dividing both sides by 7, we get B = 10. Thus, the area of the base is 10 cm².",
