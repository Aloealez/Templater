  "task": "A triangular prism has a height of 10 centimeters (cm) and a volume of 230 cm\u00b3. What is the area, in cm\u00b2, of the base of the prism? (The volume of a triangular prism is equal to B \u00d7 h, where B is the area of the base and h is the height of the prism.)",
  "answers": {
    "A": "19",
    "B": "28",
    "C": "37",
    "D": "23"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 23. The volume of a triangular prism is given by V = B \u00d7 h. Since the volume is 230 cm\u00b3 and the height is 10 cm, we solve for B: 230 = B \u00d7 10. Dividing both sides by 10, we get B = 23. Thus, the area of the base is 23 cm\u00b2.",
