  "task": "The measure of angle R is 1\u03c0 radians. The measure of angle T is 2/3\u03c0 radians greater than the measure of angle R. What is the measure of angle T, in degrees?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "180",
    "B": "600",
    "C": "120",
    "D": "300"
  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": true
  },
  "explanation": "The measure of angle R is 1\u03c0 radians, and angle T is 2/3\u03c0 radians greater. Thus, the measure of angle T is:\n\n1\u03c0 + 2/3\u03c0 = 5/3\u03c0 radians.\n\nTo convert to degrees, multiply by 180/\u03c0:\n5/3 \u00d7 (180/\u03c0) = 300 degrees.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 300 degrees.",
