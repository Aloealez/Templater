  "task": "The measure of angle R is 4/3\u03c0 radians. The measure of angle T is 7/4\u03c0 radians greater than the measure of angle R. What is the measure of angle T, in degrees?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "555",
    "B": "1110",
    "C": "315",

  },
  "correct": {
    "A": true,
    "B": false,
    "C": false,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The measure of angle R is 4/3\u03c0 radians, and angle T is 7/4\u03c0 radians greater. Thus, the measure of angle T is:\n\n4/3\u03c0 + 7/4\u03c0 = 37/12\u03c0 radians.\n\nTo convert to degrees, multiply by 180/\u03c0:\n37/12 \u00d7 (180/\u03c0) = 555 degrees.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 555 degrees.",
