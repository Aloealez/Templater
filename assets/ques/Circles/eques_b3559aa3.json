        "B": true,
        "C": false,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The measure of angle $R$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\u03c0$ radians, and angle $T$ is $\\frac{5}{3}\u03c0$ radians greater. Thus, the measure of angle $T$ is:\n$\\frac{4}{3}\u03c0 + \\frac{5}{3}\u03c0 = \\frac{3}{1}\u03c0$ radians.\nTo convert to degrees, multiply by $ 180/\u03c0 $:\n$ \\frac{3}{1}\u03c0 \u00d7 (180/\u03c0) = 540 $ degrees.\nThus, the correct answer is $ 540 $ degrees.",
