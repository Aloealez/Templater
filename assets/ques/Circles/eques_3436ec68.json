  "task": "The measure of angle R is 1/2\u03c0 radians. The measure of angle T is 2/3\u03c0 radians greater than the measure of angle R. What is the measure of angle T, in degrees?",
  "answers": {
    "A": "90",
    "B": "120",
    "C": "210",

  },
  "correct": {
    "A": false,
    "B": false,
    "C": true,
    "D": false
  },
  "explanation": "The measure of angle R is 1/2\u03c0 radians, and angle T is 2/3\u03c0 radians greater. Thus, the measure of angle T is:\n\n1/2\u03c0 + 2/3\u03c0 = 7/6\u03c0 radians.\n\nTo convert to degrees, multiply by 180/\u03c0:\n7/6 \u00d7 (180/\u03c0) = 210 degrees.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 210 degrees.",
