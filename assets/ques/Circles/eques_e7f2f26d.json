        "A": "45",

        "A": false,
        "B": false,
        "C": true,
        "D": false
    },
    "explanation": "The measure of angle $R$ is \\frac{2}{3}\u03c0 $ radians, and angle $T$ is $ \\frac{1}{4}\u03c0 $ radians greater. Thus, the measure of angle $T$ is:\n$ \\frac{2}{3}\u03c0 + \\frac{1}{4}\u03c0 = \\frac{11}{12}\u03c0 $ radians.\nTo convert to degrees, multiply by $ 180/\u03c0 $:\n$ \\frac{11}{12}\u03c0 \u00d7 (180/\u03c0) = 165 $ degrees.\nThus, the correct answer is $ 165 $ degrees.",
