{"0":{"task":"I am a two-digit number. The sum of my digits is 9. If you reverse my digits, the new number is 27 less than me. What number am I?","answers":{"S":{"text":"63","correct":true}},"explanation":"Let the tens digit be A and the ones digit be B. A + B = 9. The original number is 10A + B; the reversed is 10B + A. The difference is (10A + B) - (10B + A) = 9(A - B) = 27. So A - B = 3. Combining with A + B = 9, we get A = 6, B = 3. The number is 63."},"1":{"task":"In 3 years, twice my age will be 50.
